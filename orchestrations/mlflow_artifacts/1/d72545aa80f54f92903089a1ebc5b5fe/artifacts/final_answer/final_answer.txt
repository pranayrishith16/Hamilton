The most common statutes in the cases presented span federal criminal law, sentencing, family law, immigration law, and bankruptcy, reflecting the diverse nature of the legal issues addressed. Below is an analysis of the **most frequently cited statutes** and their legal significance, supported by authoritative precedents and statutory text.

---

### **1. Federal Criminal Law: § 924(c) (Firearms in Drug or Violent Crimes)**
- **Prevalence**: This statute appears prominently in **United States v. Duhart (2020)**, where it governed the admissibility of a firearm-related conviction under federal law.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - § 924(c)(1)(A) requires proof that a firearm was used or carried "in relation to and in furtherance of" a "crime of violence" or "drug trafficking crime."  
  - § 924(c)(3) historically included a "residual clause" for firearm use in other felonies, but this was eliminated by legislative amendment (see *United States v. Duhart*, which discussed the statutory changes).  
- **Significance**: Courts frequently interpret § 924(c) in firearms-related offenses, particularly where the nexus between the firearm and the predicate crime is contested. Precedents like *United States v. Antoine King (2020)* reinforce the requirement that the firearm must be tied to the underlying crime, not merely present.  
- **Authoritative Case**: *United States v. Duhart* clarified the elimination of the residual clause, emphasizing strict statutory construction.

### **2. Sentencing: § 3553(a) (Federal Sentencing Guidelines)**
- **Prevalence**: This statute appears in **United States v. Leonardo King (2020)**, where it dictated the district court’s sentencing discretion.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - § 3553(a) mandates that judges impose sentences considering:  
    - The seriousness of the offense and promoting respect for the law.  
    - The historical and personal characteristics of the defendant.  
    - The need to protect the public and deter criminal conduct.  
  - § 3553(a)(1) and (a)(2)(A)-(E) provide specific factors for judicial consideration.  
- **Significance**: This statute is the cornerstone of federal sentencing. Courts apply it deferentially to district court decisions, as seen in *King*, but may reverse sentences that fail to adequately weigh relevant factors or impose unwarranted variances.  
- **Authoritative Precedent**: *United States v. Croteau (2016)* established that appellate courts must give deference to district courts’ § 3553(a) analyses but may overturn sentences that ignore key factors.

### **3. Immigration Law: § 1252(a)(2)(B) (Judicial Review of Agency Actions)**
- **Prevalence**: This statute appears in **Selvin Leonardy v. Cissna (2020)**, which addressed challenges to immigration proceedings.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - § 1252(a)(2)(B) limits judicial review of decisions by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to final orders of removal or denial of adjustment of status.  
  - It carves out a narrow role for federal courts in immigration appeals.  
- **Significance**: This statute restricts direct judicial review of EOIR decisions, requiring immigrants to exhaust administrative remedies (e.g., appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals) before seeking judicial review. Courts frequently cite this provision to dismiss cases prematurely.  
- **Authoritative Precedent**: *Massignani v. Sessions (2019)* emphasized that § 1252(a)(2)(B) mirrors the Administrative Procedure Act’s (APA) finality requirement, reinforcing that courts cannot intervene until agency actions are final.

### **4. Bankruptcy Law: § 105 (Court Powers in Bankruptcy)**
- **Prevalence**: This statute appears in **Ocwen v. Marino (2020)**, a bankruptcy appeal.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - § 105(a)(1) grants bankruptcy courts the authority to issue any order "necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title."  
- **Significance**: Courts apply § 105 broadly to resolve procedural and substantive issues in bankruptcy. However, appellate review is stringent, requiring a showing that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion.  
- **Authoritative Precedent**: *In re Marino* (2020) demonstrated that appellate courts will not second-guess bankruptcy courts’ use of § 105 absent clear abuse.

---

### **5. Family Law/Criminal Law: § 30-6-1(D)(1) (Child Welfare Standards)**
- **Prevalence**: This statute appears in **United States v. Sophia Zayas (2020)**, a criminal negligence case involving child injury.  
- **Key Provisions**:  
  - § 30-6-1(D)(1) (Colorado law) defines criminal negligence as conducting conduct that creates a substantial and unjustifiable risk of serious harm.  
- **Significance**: This statute is central to convictions involving reckless conduct toward children. Courts require clear evidence that the defendant "should have known" of the risk.  
- **Authoritative Precedent**: *United States v. Zayas* emphasized that negligence requires more than mere carelessness; it demands a conscious disregard of a known or foreseeable risk.

---

### **Common Themes Across Statutes**
- **Federal Preemption**: § 924(c) and § 3553(a) reflect federal priorities in firearms and sentencing.  
- **Administrative Barriers**: § 1252(a)(2)(B) exemplifies how federal statutes limit judicial intervention in immigration cases.  
- **Strict Interpretation**: Courts often apply statutes like § 924(c) and § 30-6-1(D)(1) narrowly, requiring strict adherence to elements (e.g., nexus between firearm and crime).

### **Conclusion**
The prevalence of certain statutes—such as § 924(c) in federal firearms cases, § 3553(a) in sentencing, and § 1252(a)(2)(B) in immigration—demonstrates the critical role these laws play in modern legal practice. Their interpretations are shaped by binding precedents, as seen in *United States v. Duhart* and *United States v. Zayas*, underscoring the importance of doctrinal consistency in federal and state jurisdictions.
