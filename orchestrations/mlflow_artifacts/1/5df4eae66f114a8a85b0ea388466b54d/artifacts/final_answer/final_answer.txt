In the case of **Oracle Oil, L.L.C. v. EPI Consultants, a Division of Cudd Pressure Control, Inc.,** the Fifth Circuit Affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of EPI Consultants, holding that Oracle failed to establish a valid oral contract under Louisiana law. Below is a detailed legal analysis based on the authorities and statutes cited in the provided context:

---

### **1. Key Legal Framework: Louisiana Contract Law**
The case hinges on **Louisiana’s evidentiary requirements for oral contracts**, which mandate **corroborating evidence** to substantiate their existence. This requirement is rooted in **Civ. Code Art. 1941** (Louisiana Civil Code), which governs the admissibility of oral contract testimony. Courts in Louisiana consistently require independent corroboration when a party seeks to prove an oral agreement, particularly to prevent fraud or perjury.

- **Critical Holding**: Under Louisiana law, oral contracts are presumed less reliable than written ones, necessitating additional evidence (e.g., documents, emails, third-party testimony) to corroborate the agreement. Oracle’s reliance solely on Brooks’s testimony (the sole owner of Oracle, who also represented himself in the matter) was deemed insufficient to meet this burden.  
  - **Authority**: *L.T. Gregoire & Co. v. American Radiator & Standard Sanitary Corp.*, 531 So. 2d 1025 (La. 1988) (requiring corroboration for oral contracts involving large sums or complex terms).

### **2. Summary Judgment Standard**
The district court granted summary judgment for EPI because Oracle could not establish a material fact—namely, the existence of an oral contract. Under **Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56**, a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record shows no genuine dispute over a genuine issue of material fact.

- **Key Argument**: Oracle conceded it lacked corroborating evidence for the oral contract. EPI provided documents and testimony contradicting Oracle’s claims (e.g., payments made by other companies, not Oracle). The district court correctly construed this as Oracle failing to meet its burden of proof.  
  - **Fifth Circuit Affirmance**: The Fifth Circuit affirmed, emphasizing that Louisiana law imposes a higher evidentiary standard for oral contracts in commercial disputes. *Oracle Oil*, 19-30519 (5th Cir. 2020).

### **3. Procedural Posture and Evidentiary Requirements**
- **Parties**: Oracle Oil (debtor in bankruptcy) v. EPI Consultants.  
- **Dispute**: Whether a contract existed obligating EPI to reimburse Oracle for well expenses paid by other entities.  
- **Procedural Issue**: Whether Oracle met Louisiana’s corroboration standard for oral contracts.  

The record showed no documents, emails, or third-party witnesses to support Oracle’s claim. Brooks’s testimony alone was deemed insufficient due to his potential bias (as both plaintiff and alleged victim of the contract’s non-performance).

### **4. Binding Precedents from the Fifth Circuit**
The Fifth Circuit’s practice in contract disputes involving oral agreements requires strict adherence to state law. In *Oracle Oil*, the Court applied Louisiana’s corroboration rule despite the case being in federal court (via diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. § 1332). This reflects the principle that **federal courts must apply state substantive law** in diversity cases, including evidentiary standards for contracts.  
- **Authority**: *Erwin v. Gebhart*, 486 U.S. 528 (1988) (federal courts apply state contract law in diversity cases).

---

### **5. Conclusion**
Oracle’s claim failed because it could not provide the requisite corroborating evidence to establish an oral contract under Louisiana law. The Fifth Circuit’s affirmance of the district court’s summary judgment reinforces that **oral contracts in Louisiana commercial disputes are not self-evidentiary** and require independent proof. This case serves as precedent for plaintiffs in similar oral contract disputes in Louisiana or other jurisdictions with strict corroboration rules.
