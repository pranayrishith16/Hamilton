However, in cases in which an alien who is not an arriving alien \u201chas been placed in deportation proceedings or in removal proceedings,\u201d the Immigration Judge in the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) \u201chas exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status the alien may file.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i); see also 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.1(a)(1)(ii) (granting immigration judge in removal proceeding authority to determine applications for adjustment of status); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1) (\u201cUSCIS has jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by any alien, unless the immigration judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application under 8 CFR 1245.2(a)(1).\u201d). If an Immigration Judge denies such an application, the alien may appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b) (outlining appellate jurisdiction of Board of Immigration Appeals, which includes \u201c[d]ecisions of Immigration Judges in removal proceedings\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(a) (providing process for appeals of decisions by Immigration Judges to Board of Immigration Appeals). Certain questions in final decisions by the Board of Immigration Appeals related to removal proceedings may be appealed to the appropriate federal Court of Appeals. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter[.]\u201d); id. \u00a7 1252(b)(2) (\u201cThe petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit\nDate: February 7, 2020\nParties: \nCase Name: \nProcedural Posture: \n\nExcerpt:\ncourt.\u201d Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296, 306 (D.D.C. 2017); see also, e.g., Abdelwahab v. Frazier, 578 F.3d 817, 821 (8th Cir. 2009) (finding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) \u201cdoes not grant jurisdiction to review questions of law in district court cases\u201d but instead grants limited jurisdiction over such questions to the appropriate court of appeals); Hassan v. Chertoff, 543 F.3d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 grants limited jurisdiction to review denials of application for adjustment of status only to courts of appeals, and not to district courts). Since the enactment of the INA in 1952, various statutes, such as the 2005 REAL ID Act, have \u201climited the scope of federal court review respecting certain immigration benefits\n\n\n[10] data/2020-02-07_united_states_v._leonardo_king.pdf (Page None)\nHoldings: ['The district court must impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the\\n\\nlaw, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct.', 'The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.', 'We may not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as a whole, justify the extent of the variance.']\nDisposition: Affirmed\nStatutes: ['\u00a7 3553(a)', '\u00a7 3553(a)(1)', '\u00a7 3553(a)(2)', '\u00a7\u00a7 2119(1)', '\u00a7\u00a7 924(c)']\nCourt: UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nDate: February 7, 2020\nParties: {'plaintiff': 'United States of America'}\nCase Name: \nProcedural Posture: Appeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia\n\nExcerpt:\nlaw, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2); United States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1309 (11th Cir. 2016). The district court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. United States v. Clay, 483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 2007). The district court is not required to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; an acknowledgement that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. United States v. Turner, 474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir. 2007). However, a district court abuses its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due significant weight; (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight; or (3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors. United States v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc). The district court can rely on factors already considered in calculating the guideline range when imposing a variance. See United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 833\u201334 (11th Cir. 2007). \u201cA district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may be a symptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u201d but does not mean that it is \u201cnecessarily unreasonable.\u201d United States v.\n\n\nQuestion: tell me about most common statutes in cases\nProvide a detailed legal answer citing the most authoritative precedents and statutes."
