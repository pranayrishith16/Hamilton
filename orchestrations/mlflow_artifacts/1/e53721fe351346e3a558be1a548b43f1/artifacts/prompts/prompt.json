EPI contends that Brooks\u2019s other companies\u2014not Oracle\u2014paid all invoices for the well\u2019s expenses. But Oracle claims that Brooks, through oral contracts with himself acting on behalf of his companies, directed the payments on the understanding that Oracle would be obligated to reimburse the other companies. EPI points out that Louisiana law requires that, in addition to Brooks\u2019s testimony, Oracle must present \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d that the contract existed; Oracle has provided none.\n\nEPI moved for summary judgment. Concluding that Oracle could not establish that it had sustained damages, the district court granted the motion. We have examined the briefs, the applicable law, and pertinent parts of the record and have heard the oral arguments of counsel. The district court properly granted summary judgment as explained primarily in its comprehensive Order and Reasons entered on June 6, 2019.
