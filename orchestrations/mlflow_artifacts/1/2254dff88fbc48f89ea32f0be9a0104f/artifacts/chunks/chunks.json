The district court sentenced McDaniel to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment for Hobbs Act robbery and 84 months for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, to be served consecutively to each other but concurrently with a then yet-to-be imposed state sentence for voluntary manslaughter. McDaniel appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge and contends that the sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\nFirst, McDaniel argues that Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c). Although \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague following United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019); United States v. Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 23233, 252 (4th Cir.)

Mathis, 932 F.3d 242, 266 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, Nos. 19-6423, 19-6424, 2019 WL 6689801, 2019 WL 6689802 (U.S. Dec. 9, 2019). Therefore, the district court did not err in denying McDaniel\u2019s motion to dismiss.",

Ct. at 2113-14. But as we recently explained in Lopez-Munoz v. Barr, 941 F.3d 1013 (10th Cir. 2019), Pereira addressed only the narrow question of \u201cwhether a defective notice to appear had interrupted a noncitizen\u2019s continuous presence in the United States\u201d for purposes of the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) and \u201cdid not address the distinct question of whether a defect in the notice to appear would preclude jurisdiction over the removal proceedings.\u201d Lopez-Munoz, 941 F.3d at 1018 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider the Stay Relief Order? 3. Do we have jurisdiction over the Adversary Order? IV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW We review a bankruptcy court's order granting relief from the automatic stay for an abuse of discretion. Lakhany v. Khan (In re Lakhany), 538 B.R. 555, 559 (9th Cir. BAP 2015). Denial of a motion to amend or alter judgment under Civil Rule 59(e) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Dixon v. Wallowa Cty., 336 F.3d 1013, 1022 (9th Cir. 2003). A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion if it applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies the correct one, or makes illogical or implausible factual findings, or findings without support from the facts in the record. See TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing U.S. v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)).

The bankruptcy court acknowledged that Rodriguez had received a discharge three weeks prior to Dr. Ross filing his Stay Relief Motion, and that the discharge order discharged Rodriguez's personal liability for his prepetition debts, except for those to be determined in the adversary proceeding. Nonetheless, the court entered the Stay Relief Order granting Dr. Ross relief from the automatic stay to continue with the State Court Action. This was erroneous. Section 362 provides, in relevant part, that the filing of a bankruptcy petition stays the commencement or continuation, including the issuance or employment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title. \u00a7 362(a)(1).

By August 21, 2002, the automatic stay had long since disappeared; it was only the discharge injunction that was relevant.\"). The court abuses its discretion if it grants relief from the automatic stay after it is terminated. In re Lakhany, 538 B.R. at 561; In re Munoz, 287 B.R. at 551. The automatic stay terminated on November 14, 2018, when the bankruptcy court issued Rodriguez's discharge. The court could not thereafter grant Dr. Ross relief from the nonexistent stay, and it abused its discretion when it did so.4 Accordingly, we must REVERSE the Stay Relief Order.5 4 Proceeding to determine Rodriguez's liability in the State Court Action also would not violate the discharge injunction. The discharge injunction does not apply to this debt, because the debt is the subject of Dr. Ross's adversary proceeding seeking a determination of its dischargeability. The bankruptcy court may ultimately hold that the debt is discharged, but until that happens, the discharge injunction does not apply. See Kvassay v.

As a result, the Trooper requested Caudill to contact the owner of the truck to retrieve it.

Thereafter, the Trooper deployed a drug dog around the truck, and the dog alerted on the odor of a controlled substance at the truck\u2019s open passenger door.

Shackelford, 160 Idaho at 325, 372 P.3d at 380. We agree with Caudill that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard when denying his request for appointment of counsel.

[I]n the Court\u2019s opinion Caudill\u2019s claims do not state a valid claim for relief. Therefore, the Court denies his request for appointment of counsel at this time.

State, 131 Idaho 435, 436, 958 P.2d 592, 593 (1998) (continuously flashing turn signal constitutes reasonable suspicion of inattentive driving). Because Caudill does not dispute this basis for the Trooper\u2019s reasonable suspicion,2 that Caudill disputes the Trooper\u2019s alternative reason for stopping him-- namely, the Trooper believed Caudill\u2019s truck matched the description of the truck subject to the Amber Alert--is inapposite and does not obviate the Trooper\u2019s reasonable suspicion of Caudill\u2019s inattentive driving.\n\nSimilarly, Caudill fails to dispute that, although he did not consent to the Trooper\u2019s search of his truck, the Trooper did not conduct a search until after the drug dog alerted on the truck.

Arguably, if the Trooper opened the door to facilitate the drug-dog sweep, that conduct might be a basis for suppressing evidence. See, e.g., State v. Naranjo, 159 Idaho 258, 260, 359 P.3d 1055, 1057 (Ct. App. 2015) (ruling inquiry is whether dog\u2019s act was instinctual and whether police facilitated or encouraged act). Caudill\u2019s suggestion that he did not open the door, however, is contrary to the record which indicates that Caudill opened the door and left it open. According to the Trooper\u2019s report: \u201cBy opening the passenger door, Caudill retrieved the paperwork I requested. Caudill also left the passenger door open.\u201d More importantly, Caudill\u2019s petition fails to allege that he informed his trial counsel that Caudill disputed the Trooper\u2019s account of the search and that trial counsel failed to act on that information. Indeed, Caudill makes no allegation of his trial counsel\u2019s purported deficient performance. To the contrary, Caudill indicated during his sentencing hearing that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation. Further, Caudill did not raise the issue of who opened the passenger door during the hearing on his Rule 35 motion, despite challenging the nature of the Trooper\u2019s actions at that time. Instead, Caudill focused only on his belief that his truck did not match the description of the truck",

He argued that his public defender was ineffective for several reasons, namely: for failing to object to the factual basis; for failing to advise defendant that the method used in the bullet fragment analysis in the Yang case was no longer used by the FBI; for not properly advising him on the merits of the Yang case; for pressuring him to accept the plea deal by telling him that a death sentence would be inevitable; and for failing to demand that defendant be allowed to make a statement on his own behalf, which also rendered the proceedings legally deficient.

The defendant alleged that gang witnesses were now willing to come forward because they no longer feared being killed. Defendant argues that his situation is similar to Knight because the threat that caused him to plead guilty continued until long after the due date for his petition. \u00b6 34 Defendant argues that the terms of his plea agreement additionally contributed to his late filing, because he was told by both the prosecutor and the judge that he had no right to challenge his plea in any way.

The State argues that, instead, defendant\u2019s fear as a result of his own actions of murdering two people does not excuse an untimely petition. The State argues that this situation is distinguishable from Knight because there were no external forces or individuals threating him or forcing him to plea guilty. According to the State, defendant chose not to timely-file a postconviction petition because he knew that if he succeeded in his claims, his crimes subjected him to a more serious sentencing range. The State argues that defendant instead waited until the law changed and became more advantageous to his position. \u00b6 37 The State maintains that even if defendant was not culpably negligent in waiting to file his postconviction petition until the death penalty was abolished, the death penalty was abolished on July 1, 2011 (725 ILCS 5/119-1 (West 2012)), and defendant did not file his petition until \u201c26 months\u201d later.4 The State cites People v.

Because no substantial question is presented by this appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.1 See Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. Banks, who was a pretrial detainee at the time, filed his petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In the petition, he raised two claims: (1) certain prison officials violated his constitutional rights by not allowing delivery of religious (wicca) books or magazines that he had ordered; and (2) the prison chaplain\u2019s office discriminated against him by failing to confirm a wicca religious meal for Banks and by raising barriers to a religious visit from a wicca volunteer.

The District Court noted that the order did not apply to filings in Banks\u2019 active criminal case. Banks appealed and we affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. United States v. Miller, 726 F. App\u2019x, 107, 108 (3d Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (non-precedential).\n\nBanks claims that the VLOs do not apply to habeas petitions. But Banks sought to challenge the conditions of his pretrial confinement; his petition did not \u201cqualify as attacking the fact, duration, or execution of a sentence.\u201d See Velazquez v. Sup\u2019t Fayette SCI, 937 F.3d 151, 158 (3d Cir. 2019). Thus, Banks did not properly bring his claims in a habeas petition rather than a civil rights complaint. Cf. Cardona v. Bledsoe, 681 F.3d 533, 537-38 (3d Cir. 2012) (affirming District Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of \u00a7 2241 petition that failed to raise claims challenging the execution of the petitioner\u2019s sentence). Of course, Banks would need to have advance authorization from the District Court before filing a civil rights complaint. His petition here is a clear attempt to circumvent the VLO. The District Court properly dismissed Banks\u2019 petition as violating the VLO. We also agree that Banks\u2019 Motion to Vacate raised no valid reasons for vacating the September 30 order. For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.",

Among other things, Bell appears to contend that U.S. Bank conspired with the other defendants to fraudulently foreclose on her property and prevent her from filing for bankruptcy. On appeal, she asserts that the district court violated her constitutional rights by dismissing her complaint and that the court shouldn\u2019t have considered her complaint frivolous because decisive facts may not have emerged until discovery or trial.1 If a party fails to object to the findings or recommendations contained in an report and recommendation (R&R) after being informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences on appeal for failing to object, that party waives the right to challenge the unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions on appeal. 11th Cir. R. 3-1. Furthermore, if a pro se litigant fails to address an issue in her opening brief, that issue is deemed abandoned. Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d 870,\n\n1 The dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Bilal v. Driver, 251 F.3d 1346, 1348\u201349 (11th Cir. 2001).",

She also abandoned any argument that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint with prejudice because she did not argue that issue in her brief. Additionally, we have held that a district court doesn\u2019t violate due process in dismissing a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) where the litigant is given an opportunity to object to the R&R and the district court reviews the R&R de novo. Vanderberg v. Donaldson, 259 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 2001). So, to the extent that Bell argues that the dismissal violated due process, her argument fails because she was given an opportunity to object to the R&R, which the court reviewed de novo. Finally, motions to dismiss based on a facial challenge to the complaint should be resolved before discovery begins. Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997). Therefore, to the extent that Bell asserts that she couldn\u2019t file a proper complaint without discovery, the district court determined that her claims were facially frivolous and, therefore, properly dismissed the matter before discovery.

BEFORE: MCCLENDON, WELCH, AND HOLDRIDGE, JJ. WRIT GRANTED. The district court' s ruling granting the defendant' s motion to suppress is reversed. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the officer had the authority to detain the defendant to investigate whether the defendant was truant. See La. Ch. Code. art. 733. 1. Furthermore, although an officer has no basis for suspecting a particular individual, the United States Supreme Court has held, the officer may request consent to search. See Florida v. Bostick,\n\nU. S. 429, 435,\n\nS. Ct. 2382, 2386,\n\nL. Ed. 2d 389 ( 1991). Moreover, there was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing regarding the duration of the detention. Therefore, there is no evidence that the defendant' s consent to a search of his backpack was vitiated by an extensive detention. See State v. Brown, 2014- 0220 ( La. App. 1st Cir. 9/ 24/ 14),\n\nWL 4743079.

Following a three-day jury trial, Mulkin was found guilty of the above-mentioned crimes on April 3, 2019. On April 10, 2019, after considering a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report, the trial court sentenced Mulkin to 18-36 months\u2019 imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter, an aggravated-range sentence,6 and imposed standard-range sentences of 9-18",

The trial court stated on the record that an aggravated-range sentence on the involuntary manslaughter count was justified because Mulkin delivered drugs he knew to have recently caused others to overdose,8 and because Mulkin had previously been caught with controlled substances while incarcerated for drug possession. ____________________________________________ 5 Furanylfentanyl is a derivative of the synthetic opioid, Fentanyl. N.T. Trial, 6/20/19, at 200-23. Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and furanylfentanyl is slightly less potent than Fentanyl. Id. 6 With an offense gravity score (OGS) of 6 for involuntary manslaughter and Mulkin\u2019s prior record score (PRS) of 0, the standard-range minimum sentence at that count was 3-12 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the aggravated range minimum was 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a). 7 For sentencing purposes, Mulkin\u2019s conviction for delivery of a controlled substance merged delivery of a designer drug. 8 In May of 2016, Mulkin purchased several baggies of furanylfentanyl, which he thought contained heroin, for himself and Whitesell.

Harriott, 919 A.2d 234, 238 (Pa. Super. 2007); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(c)(8) (authorizing restitution as a condition of probation); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763(b)(10) (authorizing restitution as a condition attached to intermediate punishment); 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.14(c)(2) (restitution may be imposed as a direct sentence or as a condition of probation or intermediate punishment). Fines are also a component of a defendant\u2019s sentence; costs, on the other hand, are always incidental to judgment.

Wallace appeals his 77-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (2018). Counsel for Wallace has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning the district court\u2019s drug weight calculation and the reasonableness of Wallace\u2019s sentence. Although notified of his right to do so, Wallace has not filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons that follow, we affirm. We review a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007). Under this standard, a sentence is reviewed for both procedural and substantive reasonableness. Id. at 51. In determining procedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly calculated the defendant\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range, gave the parties an opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2018) factors, and sufficiently explained the selected sentence. Id. at 49-51. If a sentence is free of \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d then we review it for substantive reasonableness, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality of the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 51. Anders counsel questions the propriety of the district court\u2019s drug weight finding, which we review for clear error, see United States v. Crawford, 734 F.3d 339, 342 (4th Cir.",

Mondragon, 860 F.3d 227, 233 (4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court based its drug weight finding on hearsay statements from one of Wallace\u2019s codefendants, whom the court had sentenced previously. While the court largely credited the allegation that, for several weeks or months, Wallace sold cocaine out of the codefendant\u2019s residence, the court substantially reduced the drug quantity attributed to Wallace to account for the difficulty in determining historical drug weight with great precision. Based on our review of the record, we discern no clear error in the court\u2019s drug weight calculation. Next, Anders counsel generally questions the reasonableness of Wallace\u2019s sentence. However, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Wallace\u2019s Guidelines range, afforded the parties an opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at a downward variance sentence. Furthermore, nothing in the record rebuts the presumption of substantive reasonableness accorded Wallace\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence. See United States v.

Background \u00b6 4 On July 14, 2015, defendant was charged by information with one count of home invasion and one count of aggravated battery, both of which stemmed from an incident that allegedly occurred on January 5, 2015. According to the information, defendant entered Jeremy Riggs\u2019 residence in Cairo, Illinois, knowing Riggs to be present, and intentionally caused injury to Riggs by stabbing him in the hand with a knife. Defendant obtained private counsel, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on April 26, 2016. The following facts were taken from the evidence presented at the three-day trial. \u00b6 5 At trial, Riggs and his fianc\u00e9, Tiffany Bennett, testified to the following details and events surrounding the January 5, 2015, incident. Riggs and Bennett were at their shared residence when two or three masked intruders forcibly entered through the front door and demanded money. When Riggs resisted their demand and reached for his pocketknife, one intruder began striking Riggs repeatedly in the head with a gun, while the other intruders wrestled the knife away from Riggs. Both Bennett and Riggs",

See People v. Mosley, 2015 IL 115872, \u00b6 61. As such, we agree that defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction, which was based on a facially unconstitutional statute, is void.

We note that a defendant may collaterally attack his constitutionally invalid conviction on appeal and, if the constitutional infirmity is put in issue on appeal, a reviewing court \u201chas an independent duty to vacate the void judgment and may do so sua sponte.\u201d In re N.G., 2018 IL 121939, \u00b6 57.

At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the State advised the court that defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction was unconstitutional and provided the court with caselaw on the issue. Despite its assertion that the caselaw could be interpreted as allowing a court to consider an unconstitutional conviction for sentencing purposes, the State claimed that defendant\u2019s AUUW conviction was \u201cprobably inconsequential\u201d in light of the trial evidence that showed the brutal nature of the home invasion and severity of Riggs\u2019 injuries. The trial evidence showed a very violent incident where defendant, along with other individuals, invaded Riggs\u2019 residence wearing masks and attacked him with weapons, inflicting serious injuries to Riggs\u2019 head and nearly severing his hand. In imposing defendant\u2019s sentence, the circuit court stated that it considered the specific facts and circumstances of the case in the context of the trial evidence. Thus, the record indicates that the court was aware defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction was unconstitutional and that the imposed sentence was heavily influenced by the brutal nature of the home invasion. \u00b6 28 In addition, the circuit court stated that it considered all of the statutory factors in aggravation and mitigation.",

Fuller sued Narkin under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for excessive use of force. Narkin appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss Fuller\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. For the following reason, we will dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction. I. Background On October 16, 2014, Fuller led Officer Narkin on a high-speed chase through Norristown, Pennsylvania while driving a semi-trailer truck. The chase ended when Fuller crashed into a guardrail and disabled the truck. Fuller alleges that after the crash, he raised his arms in surrender and did not \u201cengage[] in any threatening behavior.\u201d A. 26. According to Fuller, Narkin fired three shots after he had surrendered, one of which struck him in the arm. Fuller brought a \u00a7 1983 action against Narkin, alleging excessive force in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Narkin filed a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds, which the District Court denied.1 The District Court accepted Fuller\u2019s",

Under both pay rates, [plaintiff] retained 28% of the GFS payment. During the second GFS engagement, [defendant] worked for a different GFS department. Under this contract, GFS paid [defendant] $150 per hour. And from June 2015 through the time of trial, [defendant] had worked a total of 2,896 hours.[3]\n\nThe Court of Appeals also summarized the disagreement about damages related to defendant\u2019s work during the second GFS engagement:\n\n[Plaintiff] provided evidence that it bore some overhead from negotiating the first contract between GFS and [defendant], but asserted that with the initial work under its belt, these costs would not be duplicated in a second placement between GFS and [defendant] . . . .

To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was required to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second GFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial, [defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours per week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s work would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16 weeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and adding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of 3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours of work.\n\nThe value of the hours then becomes critical to determining [plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that GFS paid $150 per hour under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying the total number of hours worked (3,514) by this hourly rate amounts to a total of $527,100\u2014i.e., the total value of the second GFS engagement was $527,100.",

Accordingly, the trial court was next required to calculate how much of the total contract value would have flowed into [plaintiff]\u2019s pockets. To arrive at this figure, it is appropriate to consider past dealings between the parties involved. As noted, the undisputed evidence shows that [plaintiff] retained 28% of GFS\u2019s payment during [defendant]\u2019s first GFS engagement. The evidence of these previous dealings allowed [plaintiff] to prove its damages with reasonable certainty.

Plaintiff maintained there would was no overhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100% profit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly rejected the testimony that supported this contention. Specifically, the court found that Rita Mehta, plaintiff\u2019s vice president, was not credible. It is within the purview of the trier of fact to determine credibility, and great deference is given to the fact-finder on that issue. Having found Mehta not credible, the trial court calculated damages by applying plaintiff\u2019s 2015 profit margin to the gross income it claimed it would have received from the second GFS engagement. The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for the net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable. The Court of Appeals improperly failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness credibility. I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages and remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages award.\n\nMARKMAN, J., joins the statement of ZAHRA, J.\n\n6 Resource Point LLC, unpub op at 4.",

The motion for summary judgment listed the undisputed material facts and argued that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the facts established that the defendant had violated the Columbia Code. The court thereafter issued a permanent injunction. \u00b6 20 The equitable remedy available in filing a complaint for Columbia Code violations in the trial court, as prescribed by the Illinois Municipal Code, is a permanent injunction. The administrative remedy available in filing a complaint with the Commission is revocation or suspension of the licensee\u2019s liquor license, and possible fines. The Commission\u2019s authority to revoke a liquor license is separate from a court determining whether an ordinance has been violated. The Commission has no authority to grant an injunction, and as the trial court noted on the record, it does not have jurisdiction regarding revocation of a liquor license until a decision has been rendered by the liquor control commissioner and all administrative remedies available in appealing that decision are exhausted. Here, the court explicitly excluded any issue relating to the defendant\u2019s liquor license. The court\u2019s order applied only to those counts related to the violation of the Code by the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff did not need to exhaust all administrative remedies related to the revocation of the defendant\u2019s liquor license before seeking an injunction enjoining the defendant",

Not so. Contrary to King\u2019s assertion, the district court placed great emphasis on not just one, but at least three factors: King\u2019s criminal history, the fact that he committed the offense while on probation, and the fact that he put a firearm to the back of the victim\u2019s head.

Even if we agreed that the district court relied primarily on the firearm-to-head factor, King fails to explain why such reliance is unreasonable. See Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. Also, at sentencing, King admitted that his co-defendant was less culpable than he, so his conclusory argument about sentencing disparity rings hollow. Further, the district court was entitled to rely on factors already considered in calculating the guideline range when imposing a variance. See Amedeo, 487 F.3d at 833\u201334. Finally, though King received a total sentence of 168 months, which was 21 months above the total advisory guideline range, that sentence was still well below the statutory maximum possible sentence of life, which indicates reasonableness. See Gonzalez, 550 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, we affirm King\u2019s sentence.\n\nAFFIRMED.",

As for Black\u2019s argument that Officers Simpkins and Lambeth should have obtained an arrest warrant before arresting him because they had time to do so, the Supreme Court rejected this argument in Watson. See 423 U.S. at 423. As for Black\u2019s argument that arresting him pursuant to a PCP was unreasonable, Black has overstated the role the PCP had in his arrest. As the Supreme Court has made clear, the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless arrest in a public place if law enforcement officers have probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred. White, 526 U.S. at 565; Watson, 423 U.S. at 423-34. Further, where, as here, officers have \u201cmaintained at least a minimal level of communication during their investigation,\u201d we may examine the collective knowledge of law enforcement. See Willis, 759 F.2d at 1494. Based on the collective knowledge the officers shared through the PCP, which served as a communication between Officer Ford and Officers Simpkins and Lambeth, it is indisputable that the latter two had probable cause to believe that Black had committed a felony and, thus, to lawfully arrest Black in a public place. The PCP was not used as means to arrest Black within his home or take other action\n\npermissible only through a warrant. See Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 474-75. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\nAFFIRMED.",

Henry, Henry & DeGraaff PS, Seattle, Washington; for Appellees/Appellants.\n\nIN RE MARINO\n\nOPINION LASNIK, District Judge: After the bankruptcy court entered a chapter 7 discharge injunction in June 2013, Debtors, Christopher and Valerie Marino, continued to receive letters and telephone calls from Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC (\u201cOcwen\u201d) about the home they had abandoned to foreclosure before filing for bankruptcy. Following an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court found Ocwen in contempt of the discharge injunction and imposed a $119,000 civil contempt sanction. Ocwen appeals from that order, as well as from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying its motion for reconsideration. Ocwen also appeals from the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s (\u201cBAP\u201d) conclusion that it was \u201cerror for the bankruptcy court to preclude itself from considering an award of punitive damages\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a).1 For their part, the Marinos appeal from the BAP\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal. We dismiss Ocwen\u2019s appeals for lack of jurisdiction and affirm the BAP\u2019s denial of the Marinos\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. I.

Despite the discharge injunction, the Marinos continued to receive letters and telephone calls from Ocwen about their former home. The Marinos presented evidence at a hearing showing that they had received letters and calls from Ocwen, causing them severe emotional distress. The bankruptcy court concluded that Ocwen violated the discharge injunction and imposed a civil contempt sanction of $1,000 for every violation, totaling $119,000. The bankruptcy court also concluded that it lacked the inherent authority to award punitive damages for a violation of a discharge injunction. Finally, the bankruptcy court denied Ocwen\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt and reconsideration orders but reversed and remanded on the issue of punitive damages. The BAP also denied the Marinos\u2019 motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees. Ocwen appeals from the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt and reconsideration orders. Ocwen also appeals from the BAP\u2019s decision reversing the bankruptcy court on the scope of its inherent authority to award punitive damages for a discharge injunction violation.

We conclude that all four factors compel dismissal of Ocwen\u2019s appeals. As to the first two factors, dismissal serves judicial efficiency and avoids piecemeal litigation by allowing the bankruptcy court to make additional findings of fact and conclusions of law before we exercise our jurisdiction. If we were to resolve Ocwen\u2019s appeals now, the parties would almost certainly climb back up the appellate ladder, asking us to consider the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on punitive damages.

Litigation costs generally do not qualify as irreparable harm. Cf. In re Excel Innovations, Inc., 502 F.3d 1086, 1099 (9th Cir. 2007).

We dismiss Ocwen\u2019s appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction. B. The Marinos appeal from the BAP\u2019s denial of their motion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred defending against the appeal before the BAP. Unlike Ocwen\u2019s appeals, the Marinos\u2019 appeal only raises the frivolousness of Ocwen\u2019s appeal to the BAP, an issue that is both final and discrete. We have jurisdiction over the Marinos\u2019 appeal and review it for abuse of discretion. See Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Fischel v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the U.S., 307 F.3d 997, 1005 (9th Cir. 2002)). The Marinos point to three sources that they believe entitle them to attorney\u2019s fees: (1) Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38,2 (2) the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the deed of trust with Ocwen, and (3) section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. We address each purported basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in turn. First, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, we may award damages and single or double costs to an appellee if we determine that an appeal is frivolous. See Fed. R. App. P. 38. \u201cAn appeal is frivolous if the results are obvious, or the arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d Maisano v. United States, 908 F.2d 408, 411 (9th Cir. 1990) (per",

The BAP did not clearly err in finding that the appeal was not frivolous and did not abuse its discretion by declining to sanction Ocwen under Rule 38. The Marinos are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 38. Second, the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the Marino\u2019s deed of trust with Ocwen only allows Ocwen to receive attorney\u2019s fees for \u201ca legal proceeding that might significantly affect [its] interest in the Property and/or rights under [the deed],\u201d including bankruptcy. That provision is reciprocal pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1717(a) when either party seeks to enforce or avoid enforcement of the deed. See In re Penrod, 802 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir. 2015) (citations omitted). The BAP did not err in concluding that the deed of trust did not entitle the Marinos to appellate attorney\u2019s fees. The Marinos seek to enforce the discharge injunction, not the deed of trust. Accordingly, we will not award fees under the deed of trust. Third, and finally, the Marinos argue that they should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. But that would require us to overturn our decision, In re Del Mission Ltd., 98 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 1996), in which we held that section 105(a) does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees.

The district court correctly concluded that the arbitrator neither ignored the plain terms of the 2016\u201319 collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) nor otherwise exceeded his delegated authority. First, because no provision plainly prohibited or mandated above-scale wages, the arbitrator properly considered evidence extrinsic to the CBA, including Greif\u2019s thirteen-year practice of paying such wages to deserving employees. See Edward Hines Lumber Co. of Or. v. Lumber & Sawmill Workers Local No. 2588, 764 F.2d 631, 633, 635 (9th Cir. 1985) (upholding an award that precluded the company from subcontracting more than 40% of its operations, notwithstanding a management rights clause and the absence of an \u201cexpress provision regarding subcontracting,\u201d where the arbitrator \u201cclearly based his decision in large part on the employer\u2019s undisputed historical practice of maintaining a 60\u201340 ratio\u201d of bargaining unit employees to subcontractors). Based on this practice, which persisted under materially similar predecessor CBAs, the arbitrator concluded that the above-scale wages were an implied term of the CBA. He reasonably declined",

To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was required to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second GFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial, [defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours per week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s work would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16 weeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and adding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of 3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours of work.\n\nThe value of the hours then becomes critical to determining [plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits.

Plaintiff maintained there would was no overhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100% profit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly rejected the testimony that supported this contention. Specifically, the court found that Rita Mehta, plaintiff\u2019s vice president, was not credible. It is within the purview of the trier of fact to determine credibility, and great deference is given to the fact-finder on that issue. Having found Mehta not credible, the trial court calculated damages by applying plaintiff\u2019s 2015 profit margin to the gross income it claimed it would have received from the second GFS engagement. The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for the net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable. The Court of Appeals improperly failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness credibility. I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages and remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages award.\n\nMARKMAN, J., joins the statement of ZAHRA, J.\n\n6 Resource Point LLC, unpub op at 4.",

Griffin argues the district court erred in excluding proposed testimony regarding a defense of impossibility. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Griffin was charged with arson in the third degree and attempted arson in the third degree. The charges arose after Griffin used a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d on the sidewalk outside the Bannock County Courthouse. Surveillance video captured the act and a passerby reported a burn mark and charred glass on the sidewalk. The following day, Griffin admitted to filling a beer bottle with gas with the intent to do the same. A gas station employee saw Griffin with the open",

A magistrate subsequently found probable cause and the prosecutor filed an information charging arson in the third degree and attempted arson in the third degree. Prior to trial, the State moved to exclude the testimony of Griffin\u2019s proposed expert witness whose testimony would address the inability for concrete to burn. Griffin argued the testimony was relevant because one cannot attempt to commit a crime that cannot be committed. The district court granted the motion, determining impossibility is not a defense for an attempt charge. Thereafter, the parties entered into a conditional plea agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Griffin would plead guilty to one count of attempted arson in the third degree while the remaining charge would be dismissed. Griffin reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s determination on the impossibility defense. Griffin\u2019s case proceeded to sentencing and the district court sentenced Griffin to a unified term of five years with three years determinate. The district court subsequently suspended the sentence and placed Griffin on probation for a period of four years. Griffin timely appeals. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW The trial court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and its decision to admit evidence will be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of that discretion.

ANALYSIS Griffin argues the district court erred in excluding his proposed expert and any testimony regarding a defense of impossibility. Specifically, he asserts there cannot be an attempt to commit a crime that cannot be committed. Based on this Court\u2019s precedent, the district court held that factual or legal impossibility is irrelevant for purposes of Idaho\u2019s attempt statute.1 See State v. Glass, 139 Idaho 815, 818, 87 P.3d 302, 305 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Curtiss, 138 Idaho 466, 467, 65 P.3d 207, 208 (Ct. App. 2002). Griffin argues that because cement is not combustible it is impossible for him to have attempted to burn the sidewalk and therefore it is not possible for him to be guilty of attempted arson. The State asserts there is no impossibility defense to an attempt charge and the evidence was properly excluded. The district court",

Kimberly and Charles were married and had one child\u2014K.O.B.1 During their divorce proceedings, the pair agreed to joint legal custody of K.O.B., with Kimberly retaining sole physical custody. They also agreed Charles would pay $830 per month in child support. 1 We use initials to protect the privacy of the minor child involved in this matter. Kimberly was later granted sole legal and physical custody, with Charles being awarded visitation rights and obligated to pay child support. \u00b63.

Kimberly subsequently remarried and moved to Virginia, where she is now responsible for monthly mortgage and utility payments. \u00b64. Kimberly filed a motion with the chancery court, seeking additional support to supplement the growing expenses associated with raising a teenage daughter. Kimberly testified that the costs of raising K.O.B. increased with her age: K.O.B. quickly outgrew her clothing and shoes, and K.O.B. was active in extracurricular activities that entailed additional fees and expenses. Kimberly requested that the child support be increased to at least fourteen percent of Charles\u2019 income\u2014around $3,000 per month. \u00b65. Also presented at the hearing was uncontested evidence that Charles\u2019 annual income had increased from $211,000 to $260,000. The chancery court found the increase in Charles\u2019 income to be \u201cnot insignificant\u201d and factored the increase into the modification determination. \u00b66.

Furthermore, the chancery court rejected Kimberly\u2019s request for the most part, tailoring the support increase to $1,000 per month rather than the requested $3,000 per month. We find that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm. \u00b613.

PER CURIAM:\n\nXavier Alexander appeals his 120-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, challenging the district court\u2019s determination that he is a career offender for sentencing purposes based on his two prior state felony convictions for sale of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to sell. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13. On appeal, Alexander argues that these crimes cannot be \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d that trigger the career-offender designation under the Sentencing Guidelines because (1) the more serious offense of Florida cocaine trafficking is not considered a controlled substance offense, and (2) the Florida statute defining his offenses, \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes, does not contain a mens rea requirement as to the illicit nature of the substance involved.

Shannon, 631 F.3d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 2011). In Shannon, therefore, we held that a conviction for Florida cocaine trafficking involving only the purchase of cocaine was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because the purchase of cocaine \u201cdoes not necessarily give rise to actual or constructive possession\u201d of the drug under Florida law, and the act of purchasing cocaine is not covered by the plain language of the guideline. Id. at 1188\u201390. We noted that a violation of the same Florida drug trafficking statute that involved possession with intent to distribute cocaine\u2014rather than purchase with intent to distribute\u2014would meet the definition of a controlled substance offense. Id. at 1190 & n.3. Contrary to Alexander\u2019s argument, whether a prior state felony is a controlled substance offense for purposes of the career-offender guideline depends on whether the state offense meets the definition of that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2014not on the seriousness of the offense or the severity of the penalty under state law. Cf. id. at 1190\u201391 (Marcus, J., specially concurring). In United States v.

Edi Montes-Gutierrez pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The district court1 sentenced Montes-Gutierrez to 135 months of imprisonment, below the 168 to 210 month range recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) and calculated by the district court. When determining the Guidelines range, the district court determined MontesGutierrez\u2019s base offense level was 38 due in part to the amount of methamphetamine involved in his offense. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (providing drug quantity table for determining base offense level).

The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court, which had concluded that it lacked jurisdiction in a case challenging the denial of an adjustment of status application. Id. at 357\u201359. But the plaintiff in Hosseini did not, at any point, have any removal proceedings initiated against him. Id. at 361. The government argued that the fact that the agency could, at some hypothetical future time, bring removal proceedings against the plaintiff meant that the agency\u2019s denial was not sufficiently final. Id. at 361\u201362. The court rejected that argument. See id. In particular, the court was concerned that because the agency had discretionary control over whether to initiate removal proceedings, precluding review of a plaintiff\u2019s claim could allow the agency to control whether a claim might be brought before the courts. See id. at 362. Other courts have found the same.

It is true that in many cases, including the case that Defendant cites several times, Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296 (D.D.C. 2017), there were parallel removal proceedings happening at the same time as the district court case. But Mr. Solis in this case still has not exhausted his administrative remedies because he has not sought to move to reopen his removal proceedings so that his adjustment of status application can be adjudicated there. Mr. Solis must avail himself of any administrative remedies available to him, which includes seeking adjudication of his adjustment of status application in a reopened removal proceeding. As noted above, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i), the Immigration Judge presiding over any removal proceeding has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status\u201d that an alien may file.\n\nMr. Solis suggests that he cannot avail himself of this route because he is an arriving alien, and \u201cthe Board of Immigration Appeals has held that it has no jurisdiction to consider an",

Yapp, M.D., Digestive Health Services, S.C,. and Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation1, alleging that Dr. Yapp committed medical malpractice when he perforated her esophagus while performing an endoscopy to remove a dental appliance that she had swallowed. Plaintiff contended that to repair the esophageal perforation, another surgeon performed a thoracotomy, in which her chest was opened and the tear was sewn up. Plaintiff allegedly suffered permanent injuries from the thoracotomy, which never would have happened had Dr. Yapp not negligently perforated her esophagus in the first place. \u00b6 3 Plaintiff alleged that Dr. Yapp\u2019s negligence resulted from his use of a latex hood in the course of the endoscopy to remove the dental appliance, and that he should have used a so-called \u201covertube\u201d instead, which would have reduced the chance of an esophageal perforation from occurring. Plaintiff also alleged that Dr. Yapp failed to obtain her informed consent for the procedure and that Digestive Health Services was vicariously liable for the actions of Dr. Yapp and for institutional negligence. \u00b6 4 The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred by: (1) refusing to allow her expert, Dr. Catalano, to demonstrate to the jury how an overtube could have been used to safely remove the dental appliance without perforating her",

The lower esophageal sphincter is a *** circumferential muscle [that] holds the esophagus closed. The shape of the stomach, there is a slight curve that pushes on one side of the sphincter and the other side of the sphincter. So it\u2019s not completely symmetrical. *** Q.

Complexity because it is an area, whereas you navigate the endoscope and the foreign object, they both have to turn with the esophagus otherwise there could be laceration and perforation? A.

No one was viewing the retrieval through an endoscope, the exemplar was not inside an actual person\u2019s stomach, and the individual was demonstrating the retrieval while standing next to the table with the exemplar and device lying flat on the table. Dr. Catalano, himself, demonstrated to the court what he intended to demonstrate to the jury, without the video.

Further, Dr. Catalano never examined plaintiff, never viewed her surgical scar, and never consulted with her treating physicians. In fact, no treating physician had examined plaintiff for more than two years prior to trial, meaning that no recent medical information about her constipation and pain around the surgical site was even available. \u00b6 42 The trial court found that without any expertise in performing thoracotomies, and without performing an examination of plaintiff, or reviewing a medical record of a recent examination, Dr. Catalano lacked information reasonably relied on by experts in the field to form an opinion about whether the thoracotomy caused plaintiff\u2019s continuing constipation and pain and whether such conditions were permanent.

For the same reason, the IJ concluded that Nouledo failed to show that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution or that he likely faced persecution or torture in the future. Thus, the IJ ordered Nouledo\u2019s removal to Benin and, in the alternative, to Togo.

The BIA has broadly defined a crime of child abuse to include \u201c[a]ny offense involving an intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act or omission that constitutes maltreatment of a child or that impairs a child\u2019s physical or mental well-being.\u201d In re Velazquez-Herrera, 24 I. & N. Dec. 503, 512 (BIA 2008). This Court has recognized that the phrase child abuse \u201cis meant to address conduct that is criminal,\u201d and therefore has found it \u201cappropriate to define the phrase \u2018child abuse\u2019 under the INA to capture conduct that poses a particular likelihood of harm to the child.\u201d Zhi Fei Liao v. Att\u2019y Gen., 910 F.3d 714, 721 (3d Cir. 2018). A conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b) categorically qualifies. Under that statute, \u201c[a] person commits indecent exposure if that person exposes his or her genitals in any public place or in any place where there are present other persons under circumstances in which he or she knows or should know that this conduct is likely to offend, affront or alarm.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a).

The BIA concluded that the record did not support his claim, and our review of the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. In particular, the 2016 Human Rights Report for Togo states that \u201c[t]here were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killing\u201d (A.272), \u201c[t]here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances\u201d (id.), \u201cthere were no reports that government officials employed [torture]\u201d (A.273), and \u201c[t]here were no reports of political prisoners or detainees\u201d (A.277).\n\nFinally, Nouledo argues that various equitable factors, such as his family ties to the United States, weigh against removal. As the BIA explained, however, Nouledo was not eligible for any relief on the basis of such considerations. In particular, Nouledo was not eligible for a hardship-based waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(h)) because that section does not permit the waiver of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2). Nouledo also did not argue before the Agency and has not argued before us that he was eligible for cancellation of removal. He was not because he had not accrued seven years of continuous residence following his admission. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2).

Although it does appear Appellant\u2019s response was timely filed pursuant to the prisoner mailbox rule,4 his objections to the court\u2019s order are aptly raised in his brief on appeal.

Appellant insists he is entitled to PCRA relief because he filed his petition within one year of the McCoy decision, which Appellant maintains constituted a newly discovered fact pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(ii), or a newly recognized constitutional right pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(iii).

WESTBROOKS, J., FOR THE COURT: \u00b61. Don Lewis pleaded guilty to fondling a child and was sentenced to fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with four years to serve and eleven years of post-release supervision (PRS). It was later alleged that Lewis had violated the terms of his PRS. The Pearl River County Circuit Court held a revocation hearing and revoked Lewis\u2019s PRS. Lewis filed a motion for post-conviction relief (PCR), claiming his probation was unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s motion. Aggrieved, Lewis appeals. After reviewing the record, we reverse and remand to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \u00b62. In 2007, Lewis was indicted for and pleaded guilty to the fondling of a child in violation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23(1) (Supp. 1998). He was",

He was sentenced to fifteen years in the MDOC\u2019s custody, with four years to serve and eleven years of PRS. Lewis was also ordered to pay a $1,500.00 fine and $654.00 in restitution. In May 2015, an MDOC supervising officer alleged that Lewis violated the terms of his PRS by being arrested once for simple-assault domestic violence and twice for DUI, as well as for failing to pay his fines. The circuit court held a revocation hearing. \u00b63. At the revocation hearing, Lewis admitted to the arrests. No further testimony was provided concerning them, and the record includes no other information about them. Regarding the fines, the record is equally unclear. At the close of the hearing, the circuit court found Lewis \u201cguilty,\u201d revoked his PRS, and reinstated the seven-year and five-month balance of his sentence. On March 28, 2018, Lewis filed a PCR motion claiming that his probation had been unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s PCR motion on June 5, 2018. Lewis filed his notice of appeal on July 2, 2018. \u00b64. Lewis raises five issues on appeal, but they can be properly addressed with two questions.

DISCUSSION OF ISSUES AND ANALYSIS I. Section 47-7-37 \u00b66. Lewis argues that he should benefit from the 2018 amendment to section 47-7-37. The amendments changed the focus in revocations to the number of prior revocations, rather than the number of technical violations. For Lewis to benefit,1 the amendment would have to be applied retroactively to his revocation hearing in June 2015. Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-1 (Rev. 2015) provides as follows: No statutory change of any law affecting a crime or its punishment or the collection of a penalty shall affect or defeat the prosecution of any crime committed prior to its enactment, or the collection of any penalty, whether such prosecution be instituted before or after such enactment; and all laws defining a crime or prescribing its punishment, or for the imposition of penalties, shall be continued in operation for the purpose of providing punishment for crimes committed under them, and for collection of such penalties, notwithstanding amendatory or repealing statutes,",

When the subject statute was amended by the Legislature, it did not express that the amendment should be retroactively applied. Lewis\u2019s contention that the amendment should apply in his case is without merit. II. Revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS Due to Arrests \u00b67. Lewis next argues the circuit court erred by revoking his PRS after adjudicating him \u201cguilty\u201d of multiple offenses and violations without sufficient evidence. In its \u201cOrder Denying Motion for Post-Conviction Collateral Relief,\u201d the circuit court stated that \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s own admission is a sufficient basis to find he violated the terms of his PRS.\u201d The circuit court\u2019s order also states that Lewis admitted \u201che had not paid his fees and fines as ordered.\u201d The record is unclear as to whether such a statement concerning Lewis\u2019s fines is accurate. Lewis contends he paid the fines in full with the financial assistance of his mother. There was no evidence or testimony to support any allegation that Lewis had not paid his fines. Lewis provided the only testimony at his revocation hearing. No further evidence or details concerning the arrests were provided. The sole foundation for the revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS was his admission that he was arrested three times while on PRS and the circuit court\u2019s apparent issue concerning Lewis\u2019s fines. \u00b68.

A review of the circuit court\u2019s order demonstrates that the circuit court did not meet that standard. \u00b69. The instant case is factually similar to Brown in that the only basis for the revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS is his own admission that he was arrested. The circuit court did not conduct any evidentiary inquiries of Lewis or anyone else. After Lewis admitted to being arrested, the circuit judge asked the following question, \u201cYou, also, had a guilty conviction on drug charges in 1993. And by your own admission, your mother\u2019s check is paying your fees and fines and she\u2019s having to keep you in compliance with probation. I have one question for you. What good are you to anybody?\u201d Lewis attempted to explain and answer the question concerning the fines by stating he had lost his job.

Your probation is revoked. That way, she doesn\u2019t have to pay your fees and fines.\u201d The circuit court failed to reference any evidentiary or factual basis for revoking Lewis\u2019s PRS because of the status of his fines.

On January 18, 2015, the victim, A.D., attended a work party at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago with her boyfriend, Paul Green. Green worked as a bar manager at a restaurant called Bacinos. Prior to the party, A.D. met Green at a bar, Harding Tavern, to watch a football game. A.D. testified that she drank two craft beers at Harding Tavern. They then went to another bar, Emerald Loop, where A.D. drank two or three more beers and had one or two shots of liquor. Green and A.D. then left Emerald Loop to go to the party at the Hyatt Regency. \u00b6 5 A.D. testified that she felt intoxicated by the time she arrived at the party, which was in a suite at the hotel. There were about 12-15 people at the party, but she only knew Green and one other woman. A.D. testified that she did not recall drinking more alcohol at the party, but she had difficulty remembering the events of that portion of the night. The next thing A.D. remembered was that she was in a bedroom that was connected to the suite. A.D. could not recall how she got into the bedroom. \u00b6 6 A.D. testified that the first thing she saw when she woke up was a naked man, who she did not know, on top of her. A.D. stated that the man\u2019s penis was \u201cbrushing\u201d against her vagina. A.D. was not wearing any clothes. A.D. put her hands on the man\u2019s chest and pushed him away.

Specifically, defendant complains of Green\u2019s testimony that A.D. told him she had been raped, Cerna\u2019s testimony that A.D. stated she had been sexually assaulted, and Bembenista\u2019s testimony that A.D. told her she was vaginally penetrated by defendant. The State responds that the complained-of testimony was neither objected to at trial or raised in a posttrial motion, and thus has been forfeited for review. See People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 122 (2007) (to preserve claimed improper statements for review, a defendant must object to the statements both at trial and in a written posttrial motion).

See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 678-79 (9th Cir. 2011). To the contrary, the BIA accepted the evidence submitted as true, but concluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the Ethiopian government would target him. Second, Zewdu failed to produce evidence of an individual risk or harm.2 Notably, Zewdu did not present any new evidence of threats to him or his family. Finally, the worsening conditions did not materially affect Zewdu\u2019s claim for asylum based on his political opinion and ethnicity. Despite worsened human rights conditions in Ethiopia, Zewdu failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that his circumstances have materially changed since his previous proceeding. 2 Zewdu argues that the BIA should have considered his claim as one of a pattern and practice of persecution, thereby lessening the threat of individual persecution he needs to establish. However, the BIA properly rejected any claim that Zewdu was a member of a disfavored group or that there was a pattern or practice of persecution. See Wakkary v. Holder, 558 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir. 2009). Even though the record shows the Ethiopian government targets politically active Oromo and Amhara citizens, this evidence is insufficient to",

Moreover, the record belies Wallace\u2019s assertion. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 2/27/19, at 6.

Id. Although she found the sufficiency challenges to be non-frivolous, appellate counsel believed that it would be more beneficial for Wallace if she zealously argued what she perceived to be his strongest claim.

Colleen alleged that Diane was acting as Patricia\u2019s agent under Patricia\u2019s purported power of attorney for health care, dated February 22, 2016, a copy of which she attached to her amended complaint.2 \u00b6 5 Colleen further alleged that, in 2011, Patricia, who lived in Nebraska with her son, Richard Masek (who has autism and developmental/intellectual disabilities), had undergone testing that revealed significant memory loss and cognitive decline and she was prescribed dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s medication. According to Colleen, in February 2014, to Colleen\u2019s surprise, Diane and her husband removed Patricia and Richard from their Nebraska home and moved them to Diane\u2019s home in Downers Grove, where they have since resided. Since that time, Diane has been Patricia\u2019s caretaker and primary decisionmaker. \u00b6 6 In 2014, Patricia was in the moderate-to-late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suffered from severe short-term memory loss, and needed a caregiver.

Prior to her removal from Nebraska, Patricia had frequent and positive interactions with Colleen and her family. Following her removal from Nebraska, Patricia has had limited interaction with Colleen and her family, according to Colleen, due to Diane\u2019s involvement, conduct, and decisions she has made for Patricia. Colleen further alleged that Patricia\u2019s estrangement and isolation from her and her family (and other family members and friends) directly result from Diane\u2019s involvement, conduct, and decisions made for Patricia and influence on her. Colleen alleged that she and others have attempted to visit and communicate with her mother, but have not received any reply. \u00b6 7 Colleen further asserted that, as agent for Patricia, Diane undertook a fiduciary duty to her and is required to act in Patricia\u2019s best interests.

To show actual possession of contraband, the State must show that the contraband was \u201cin the immediate and exclusive control of [the] defendant.\u201d See People v.

Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d at 82. \u201cActual possession does not require present personal touching of the illicit material but, rather, present personal dominion over it.\u201d Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d at 82. \u00b6 23 The State may show actual possession through acts such as hiding or trying to dispose of the contraband. E.g., People v. Carodine, 374 Ill. App. 3d 16, 25 (2007). In other words, a defendant exhibits present personal dominion by doing things that tend to determine the fate of the contraband. \u00b6 24 The State argues that defendant\u2019s furtive movements permit an inference that he was in actual possession of the gun. It contends that it is fair to infer that, when defendant was moving in the car with his hands out of Butur\u2019s view, he was either removing the gun from his person or trying to push it out of",

Defendant could have placed the gun there at any time while he was in the car. \u00b6 26 The jury was free to reject the inference that Davis, the driver, placed the gun in the seat pocket and simply left it there when he walked to the beach. Butur found the gun in a place that was readily accessible to a passenger in the rear-right seat, where defendant was seated. The relative lack of access makes it less likely that the driver or front passenger left the gun in the pocket. The evidence did not physically exclude the possibility that Davis abandoned a fully loaded semiautomatic handgun with a round in the chamber and the safety off. But although that scenario is possible, it is improbable; the State is not required to present evidence that excludes every reasonable hypothesis of a defendant\u2019s innocence. Larson, 379 Ill. App. 3d at 654. \u00b6 27 Defendant notes that Scott denied seeing defendant handle the gun and indeed even seeing the gun before the police seized it. This, if true, would undermine the inference that he placed the gun in the seat pocket. However, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Scott was not credible. By her own account, she was intoxicated at the time, and her association with defendant created a motive for her to understate any observations that would tend to incriminate",

    "content": "Doe had bruised the eldest child\u2019s upper lip while covering his mouth to stifle his crying. The two children were then placed in the protective custody of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Case plans were developed for Doe and the children\u2019s fathers.1 While the child protection case was pending, John Doe III was born. Because Doe had made little progress on her case plan, Doe III was also taken into the Department\u2019s protective custody. The State eventually filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Doe and the children\u2019s fathers. Neither father contested the termination of his parental rights. Following trial, the magistrate court terminated Doe\u2019s parental rights after finding clear and convincing evidence that she had neglected the children and that termination is in their best interests.2 Doe appeals. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW On appeal from a decision terminating parental rights, this Court examines whether the decision is supported by substantial and competent evidence, which means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243, 245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009).

    "content": "Doe argues the magistrate court erred in concluding that termination is in the children\u2019s best interests. Specifically, Doe asserts that the magistrate court failed to give proper consideration to the children\u2019s lack of permanent placement at the time of trial and Doe\u2019s potential to reunify with the children if given adequate mental health services. The State responds that the magistrate court\u2019s decision to terminate was correct and had proper evidentiary support. We affirm the magistrate court\u2019s decision. As alluded to above, Doe does not challenge the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion that the State established a statutory ground for termination or that the children were in the Department\u2019s custody for fifteen of the past twenty-two months. Thus, our only task is to review the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion that termination is in the children\u2019s best interests. Once a statutory ground for termination has been established, the trial court must next determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parent-child relationship. In re Aragon, 120 Idaho 606, 611, 818 P.2d 310, 315 (1991). When determining whether termination is in the child\u2019s best interests, the trial court may consider the parent\u2019s history with substance abuse, the stability and permanency of the home, the unemployment of the parent, the financial contribution of the parent to the child\u2019s care after the child is placed in protective custody, the improvement of the child while in foster care,",

The two older children suffered speech delays and aggression issues while the younger child required physical therapy to address an issue with his neck. Despite Doe\u2019s lack of participation in their therapy, the magistrate court found that the children showed significant improvement while in foster care.

Although the children had yet to receive a permanent adoptive placement at the time of the termination trial, they were in a pre-adoptive placement and were wellbonded with those foster parents. It is possible that these potential parents will decline to adopt the children; however, that does not mean the children\u2019s permanency and stability would be better served by leaving the children in Doe\u2019s custody.

If weighing evidence\u2019s prejudicial effect were not required under the Lemay analysis, the sole question for a court to consider would be whether the evidence was relevant; there would be no need to consider the degree of relevance, as LeMay demands. See id. at 1027\u201330. Accordingly, weighing the prejudicial effect against the probative value of such evidence is a vital piece of the LeMay factor analysis.

    "content": "PER CURIAM. David Rodish pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The charge followed Rodish\u2019s arrest for his part of a large methamphetamine distribution conspiracy in the greater Des Moines area dealing with several pounds of methamphetamine and hundreds of thousands of dollars. The suggested Guidelines range based on Rodish\u2019s criminal history was 141 to 177 months. At sentencing, Rodish sought a downward variance to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months and the government sought a sentence of 141 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range. The district court1 sentenced Rodish to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Rodish challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, claiming the district court erred in failing to appropriately balance the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of certain mitigating factors such as the nature of his prior criminal convictions (specifically that a majority of his criminal history points were derived from convictions for driving while barred), his childhood difficulties, his mental health conditions, and his performance while on pretrial release. These mitigating factors, according to Rodish, were only given \u201ccursory\u201d consideration by the district court. He additionally argues the court gave too much weight to the nature and circumstances of the larger",

In the last reasoned state court decision, the court examined Gross\u2019s claims under New York\u2019s constitutional standard for ineffective assistance. As we have explained, \u201c[t]he first prong of the New York test is the same as the federal test; a defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d See Rosario v. Ercole, 601 F.3d 118, 124 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480 (2005)).2 The state court held that Gross failed to meet the New York test\u2013\u2013and therefore the first prong of Strickland\u2013\u2013for ineffective assistance. Specifically, the court held that, \u201cdefendant\u2019s trial counsel was thoroughly familiar with the underlying facts of the case, made sufficient pretrial motions, delivered appropriate opening and closing statements, raised appropriate objections, cross-examined the prosecution witnesses, and effectively presented a defense in furtherance of a reasonable trial strategy in the face of strong opposing evidence.\u201d App\u2019x 192. We do not think that this conclusion is unreasonable. Gross raises additional arguments regarding defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission or use of prior consistent statements of various witnesses, but much of this testimony was in fact admissible under New York law.

For these reasons, we find that Gross is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Next, we turn to Gross\u2019s freestanding innocence claim. \u201cThe Supreme Court has not finally resolved the issue of whether there is a federal Constitutional right to be released upon proof of actual innocence.\u201d Friedman v. Rehal, 618 F.3d 142, 159 (2d Cir. 2010).

Boone explained under oath that he understood the appeal waiver and that his sentence could include a period of supervised release during which he would be subject to court-imposed conditions. At the conclusion of the plea hearing, the magistrate judge found that Boone\u2019s guilty pleas were knowing, voluntary, and supported by independent factual bases.\n\nOn March 20, 2017, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, adjudged Boone guilty of the two offenses charged in the information, and conducted Boone\u2019s sentencing. During that hearing, the court calculated an advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 37 to 46 months in prison and heard from the parties regarding the appropriate sentence. Pursuant to the government\u2019s obligations under the plea agreement, the prosecutor requested an eighteen-month sentence. On the other hand, Boone asked for a term of probation predicated on his \u201csignificant medical issues.\u201d See J.A. 55. In support of that leniency request, Boone\u2019s cardiologist testified at the hearing, explaining that Boone suffers from hypertension so severe that the cardiologist was \u201cconcerned about [Boone\u2019s] survival, [even] independent of incarceration.\u201d Id. at 37.",

Owners filed a counterclaim alleging that Sunflower violated the terms of the policy by (a) failing to timely report the hail damage, and (b) submitting a claim and proof of loss that grossly overstated the cost of repairing the hail damage. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Owners on all of Sunflower\u2019s claims. The case then proceeded to trial on Owners\u2019 counterclaim, and the jury found in favor of Owners. The district court entered final judgment in favor of Owners. Sunflower now appeals, arguing that the district court (1) erroneously instructed the jury to impute fraudulent intent to Sunflower through the conduct of its independent contractors, (2) erred in denying Sunflower\u2019s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law (JMOL), (3) erred in concluding that the policy afforded Owners a recoupment remedy, (4) denied Sunflower a fair trial as the result of two erroneous evidentiary rulings, and (5) erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Owners on all of Sunflower\u2019s claims.

Included among Sunflower\u2019s proposed jury instructions was an instruction defining the term \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and effectively asking the jury to determine whether R3NG and/or Matrix were\n\nindependent contractors. ECF No. 164 at 10. Nowhere in this proposed instruction was the term \u201cagent\u201d defined or even mentioned. Likewise, Sunflower\u2019s proposed verdict form contained no mention of the word agent. And, again, Sunflower made no mention of the Policy strictly limiting fraudulent conduct to Sunflower alone.\n\nOwners\u2019 set of proposed jury instructions included a number of instructions that addressed agency. For example, Owners\u2019 proposed instruction I described how an agency relationship is created and defined the terms agent and principal. ECF No. 167 at 14. There was also a proposed instruction on the apparent authority of an agent, another stating that any misrepresentations or omissions made by an agent are deemed misstatements or omissions of the principal, and, finally, an instruction stating that Matrix, Ford, Client Preference, Countryman, R3NG, Domecq, and every board member were agents of Sunflower. Id. at 15\u201316. Although the caption of Owners\u2019 proposed instructions stated they were \u201cDISPUTED,\u201d Owners did not identify Sunflower\u2019s precise objection to the instructions, nor did Sunflower file a written objection to Owners\u2019 proposed instructions.",

At the close of Owners\u2019 case-in-chief, Sunflower moved for JMOL, arguing that (a) policyholders may legally present inaccurate proofs of loss without conscious dishonesty or intent to defraud, and (b) that Owners\u2019 evidence failed to establish that Sunflower submitted a knowingly inflated proof of loss. With respect to this latter argument, Sunflower asserted that Owners presented the testimony of its independent adjuster Gary Stevens, and that Stevens never talked to Ford or Domecq, the two people who prepared Sunflower\u2019s proof of loss. Again, however, Sunflower made no mention of any issues regarding agency. The district court took Sunflower\u2019s motion for JMOL under advisement.",

Specifically, Sunflower is asserting that it was entitled to JMOL because (a) the plain language of the Policy\u2019s Fraud Clauses limited the scope of those clauses to actions taken directly by Sunflower and its employees, and does not apply to actions taken by agents working on behalf of Sunflower, such as R3NG and Domecq, and (b) Owners presented no evidence at trial establishing that Sunflower or its employees were responsible for the misrepresentations contained in the proof of loss. As discussed above, however, Sunflower fails in its opening appellate brief to address the district court\u2019s conclusion that it forfeited these arguments by failing to raise them in a timely fashion prior to trial. We therefore conclude that, as with its\n\nchallenge to the district court\u2019s instructions on agency, Sunflower has effectively waived any challenge it may have to the district court\u2019s forfeiture ruling. 3) Does the Policy provide a recoupment remedy?",

Stevens testified, independent of the evidence of the 2007 bids and invoices, about multiple categories of items in Sunflower\u2019s proof of loss that, based upon his experience and expertise, were inflated and unreasonably excessive. Sunflower, during its case, presented testimony from Jason Domecq of R3NG, one of the two people who prepared and submitted the proof of loss on behalf of Sunflower. As previously discussed, Domecq proved to be a disastrous witness for Sunflower. Domecq offered no explanation for numerous line items contained in the proof of loss.

The district court held that Plaintiffs could not make a claim against SCI Cal under \u00a7 2810.3 for on-call liability based on Serenity\u2019s labor violations. The court reasoned that \u00a7 2810.3\u2019s definitions of \u201cclient employer,\u201d \u201clabor contractor,\u201d and \u201cusual course of business\u201d all \u201creference work that is performed.\u201d Id. at *17 (emphasis in original). In particular, the \u201cusual course of business\u201d for which the client employer obtains or is provided labor is work \u201cperformed within or upon the premises or the worksite of the client employer.\u201d Id. (quoting Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2810.3(a)(6)). This qualifier excluded liability for on-call time against SCI Cal because the time a driver spent awaiting a dispatch call to \u201cany Serenity client\u201d was not work \u201c\u2018performed on the premises or worksite\u2019 of SCI.\u201d Id. at *19, *17 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, common questions did not predominate in a sub-class defined as all drivers \u201cmade available\u201d to SCI Cal. Id. at *19; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Although an individual driver who performed labor for SCI Cal, and was not merely \u201cmade available\u201d by being on call for Serenity, could potentially show liability under \u00a7 2810.3, such an inquiry would be highly individualized.",

See Senne, 934 F.3d at 926. In the relevant period, Serenity had about eighty regular clients, and SCI Cal comprised less than fifteen percent of Serenity\u2019s business during at least part of this time. Although SCI Cal may be liable for the time during which Plaintiffs \u201cperformed\u201d labor for it, the district court did not err in its bottom-line conclusion that \u00a7 2810.3 does not impose liability for the time during which members of the putative class, many of whom may have never actually completed a dispatch for SCI Cal during any given shift, awaited a dispatch to any one of Serenity\u2019s many clients. The court\u2019s determination of the scope of liability under \u00a7 2810.3 was not a premature merits ruling, but the type of \u201crigorous analysis\u201d of Rule 23 requirements that, in appropriate cases, district courts properly conduct in a class certification decision. Wal-Mart, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); see also Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d 970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011). Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred by indicating that it would deny class certification against Serenity for overtime, minimum wage, and meal and rest break claims in the event that the court found that Serenity is not liable for such claims during on-call time.

The parties engaged counsel to resolve the dispute but were unsuccessful. Plaintiff insisted defendant owed him a credit and refused to pay the additional alimony until she paid the sum. Defendant filed a motion to enforce litigant's rights to recover the lump sum alimony she purported was owed. We focus on the parties' dispute regarding the 2015 alimony calculation, which is related to this appeal. In her motion, defendant included the 1122 RSUs in her calculation of plaintiff's gross 2015 earnings and calculated his income to be $429,609.69. Pursuant to the MSA, to determine plaintiff's 2015 additional lump sum alimony obligation, defendant subtracted $220,000 and the value of the 200 RSUs attributable to her. She divided the net figure by 33.3%, yielding $59,728.77 as the additional lump sum alimony. She subtracted $13,367.65, which plaintiff previously paid for 2015, leaving $46,361.12 outstanding.\n\nA-2370-18T3",

Utilizing the same total earnings of $429,609.69, he subtracted the total value of the 1122 RSUs, other expenses, and the $220,000 yielding $19,224. Dividing this sum by one-third, plaintiff netted $6408 as the additional lump sum amount. He reasoned because he had paid defendant $13,367, she owed him $69592, representing an overpayment. The motion judge heard oral argument and concluded the following: The parties were . . . represented by counsel as they negotiated this agreement . . . and had . . . an opportunity to thoroughly [vet] each and every paragraph within the [MSA] before signing [it].\n\nAs such, the [c]ourt finds that this agreement would not appear . . . to be based on any form of coercion, duress, or fraud.\n\nSo[,] in light of the absence of any finding of coercion, duress, or fraud the MSA stands as it is written.\n\nNow, [three] and a half years later plaintiff has buyer's remorse and wants to upend the agreement. . . . Clearly and carefully [the MSA] sets forth a base alimony under Paragraph [fourteen.]\n\nAnd the crux of this argument is . . . the initial lump sum alimony and the amounts and the calculation for the additional lump sum alimony, and what the additional lump sum alimony entails.\n\n2 Plaintiff's final sum was $6960, which we assume was a product of rounding.\n\nA-2370-18T3",

Lerbakken filed for bankruptcy, claiming that his interests in the IRA and 401(k) are exempt as \u201cretirement funds.\u201d Sieloff & Associates, P.A., a creditor, objected to the exemptions. The bankruptcy court disallowed them, ruling that Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) are not retirement funds. In re Lerbakken, Order, BKY 18-50037 (Bankr. D. Minn. May 15, 2018). Lerbakken appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, which affirmed. Lerbakken v. Sieloff & Assoc., P.A. (In re Lerbakken), 590 B.R. 895, 897-98 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2018). Lerbakken appeals the BAP\u2019s judgment. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1), this court affirms. I. Sieloff represented Lerbakken in his dissolution in Minnesota. The court\u2019s decree awarded Lerbakken all of his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and half of her 401(k). The court ordered Lerbakken to submit a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO). Lerbakken refused, which leaves him with only a domestic relations order. Two months after the decree, the court ordered an attorney\u2019s lien against Lerbakken for Sieloff\u2019s legal services. The court expressly permitted Sieloff to recover the unpaid fees from Lerbakken\u2019s interests in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and 401(k). The unpaid fees exceed the total of Lerbakken\u2019s interests. -2Six months after the decree, Lerbakken filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7,",

In Clark, the Court defined \u201cretirement funds\u201d as \u201csums of money set aside for the day an individual stops working.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 127. The Court focused on three significant legal characteristics of ordinary retirement funds. Id. at 125. Account holders of ordinary retirement funds (1) are able to make additional contributions to the funds, (2) are not obligated to withdraw the funds, and (3) must pay a penalty to withdraw the funds at any time, for any purpose, prior to the age of 59 \u00bd.

III. As for the IRA, Lerbakken\u2019s most cogent argument is that the Internal Revenue Code says that an IRA transferred incident to divorce is \u201ctreated as an individual retirement account of such [recipient] spouse, and not of such [donor] individual.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(d)(6).

Second, state law obligates Lerbakken to withdraw his conditional interest in the IRA. Lerbakken\u2019s interest is defined by state law. See Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979) (holding that, absent a contrary federal interest, \u201c[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law\u201d).

Lerbakken advances four broad arguments. First, he says that the BAP and the bankruptcy court misapplied Clark by limiting the \u201cretirement funds\u201d exemption \u201cto individuals who create and contribute funds into the retirement account.\u201d In re Lerbakken, 590 B.R. at 897 (discussing the ordinary usage of retirement funds as excluding funds set aside for retirement by a different person). As Clark says, the key 5Because Lerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in the 401(k) is not \u201cretirement funds,\u201d this court need not address the \u201ccovered account\u201d requirement. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 131. See also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C). -7features of \u201cretirement funds\u201d are the objective legal characteristics. Clark, 573 U.S. at 125, 128-29. As discussed, Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) do not have the necessary legal characteristics. Second, Lerbakken argues that the similar tax treatment of transferred and surviving-spouse IRAs necessitates treating accounts transferred incident to divorce the same as accounts inherited by surviving spouses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(d)(3)(C)(ii), (d)(6). However, the Court suggests that even a surviving spouse\u2014which Lerbakken is not\u2014does not have \u201cretirement funds\u201d when the surviving spouse does not roll over the IRA into his own IRA.

In June 2003, defendant pleaded guilty to count II and was sentenced to a two-year term of probation to be served consecutively to a sentence of imprisonment he was serving in an unrelated case. The terms of defendant\u2019s probation required him to, inter alia, report to his probation officer within one week of his release from prison and pay (1) court costs and (2) a $25 per month probation fee. \u00b6 7 In April 2005, the State filed a petition to revoke defendant\u2019s probation, alleging he violated the terms of his probation by failing to report to his probation officer within seven days of his release from imprisonment, and the trial court issued an arrest warrant. On January 17, 2006, defendant was arrested and posted a $300 bail bond to secure his release from custody. Defendant admitted the allegations in the State\u2019s petition, and the trial court ordered a presentence investigation report (PSI) be prepared for resentencing.

Relying on section 110-7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Criminal Code) (725 ILCS 5/110-7 (West 2004)), defendant contends the circuit clerk had a statutory duty to return his bail bond.

We note, in resolving defendant\u2019s first probation violation the court imposed a $500 fine. Also, the court\u2019s order on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or revoke fines vacated the balance owed at the time the order was entered but did not vacate the imposition of any prior fines. Thus, the court\u2019s order in no way vacated the prior application of bond money to previously assessed fines, fees, and costs. Accordingly, we conclude defendant is not entitled to a refund of his bail bond deposit. Based on this conclusion, we also find that, even assuming the trial court erred in conducting the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion without defendant being present, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \u00b6 21\n\nIII.

At the January 2015 hearing, the IJ warned Petitioner that his daughter would cease to be a qualifying relative in January 2016, and the IJ double-booked his calendar for a December 2015 hearing in an effort to accommodate Petitioner.

Four and one-half years later, in May 2018, petitioner petitioned to dissolve the marriage and for temporary or permanent maintenance. She claimed that she was entitled to permanent maintenance given the parties disparate finances and her inability to work because she suffered from multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, and lymphoma. \u00b6 5 Financial affidavits submitted to the court revealed that respondent received monthly pension payments and social security benefits totaling $8130. After his monthly expenses were deducted from this amount, he was left with a surplus of $2931. Petitioner\u2019s affidavit revealed that every month she received $600 in rent and $1100 in monetary gifts. After her living expenses were deducted, she was left with a deficit of $2068. \u00b6 6 Both parties had little debt and few assets. Respondent owned a vacation home in Wisconsin that he purchased for $22,000. This home was purchased during the marriage. He also owned two boats. Petitioner bought one of the boats as a gift for respondent, spending between $4000 and $5000 for it. Petitioner owned the home in which she and respondent lived during the marriage. The fair market value of that home was $245,620, with an outstanding mortgage of $135,000. Given the parties\u2019 circumstances, the court awarded petitioner temporary maintenance of $2099 per month. These payments began on January 1, 2019. \u00b6 7 At the hearing on the petition to dissolve the marriage,",

Because the trial court has the discretion to award maintenance, we will not disturb the trial court\u2019s maintenance award absent an abuse of discretion. In re Marriage of Sturm, 2012 IL App (4th) 110559, \u00b6 3. A trial court abuses its discretion only if no reasonable person would adopt the trial court\u2019s view. Id. \u00b6 16 When a party challenges a trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning maintenance, we will not reverse those findings unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. Findings are against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite conclusion is clearly evident or where the court\u2019s findings are unreasonable, arbitrary, and not based on any of the evidence.

Respondent never testified that he made such a promise, and even if he had, it is difficult to conclude that respondent truly intended to take care of petitioner well after their relationship had soured, rather than just during the marriage. \u00b6 23 Petitioner argues that she should have been awarded permanent maintenance, because both parties testified that she was disabled. We disagree. The fact that both parties believed that petitioner was disabled did not mean that the court had to accept that belief as fact. Moreover, respondent was disabled too. The court noted during trial that it would afford the proper weight to testimony that petitioner was disabled, noting that no evidence other than the parties\u2019 testimony was presented on that issue. See, e.g., Kraft Foods, Inc. v. Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board, 2013 IL App (2d) 121031, \u00b6 58 (rejecting proposition that trier of fact must accept unrebutted testimony); Franciscan Communities, Inc. v.

After the collision, the driver of the Geo Prizm, later identified as Leonard, drove away from the scene. Lynn followed the vehicle and found the Geo Prizm abandoned on Fairview Avenue. Later that day, Lynn contacted the police about the incident. Corporal Andrew Hominsky went to Fairview Avenue to recover the damaged vehicle. Corporal Hominsky discovered that the damaged vehicle was the same vehicle that Kessler had reported stolen earlier that day to Officer Harvey. The damage to the vehicle was consistent with the details of the collision that Lynn had described. That evening, an employee of the Carnegie Free Library in Connellsville reported the presence of a suspicious person. Office Harvey and Lieutenant Tom Patton responded to the call and found Leonard asleep in the library\u2019s computer room with a variety of items surrounding him, including an Xbox One console, BB guns, and a book bag containing knives, controllers, and clothing.

By contrast, in Lloyd, the defendant took the property from a barn in the middle of the night and had no connection to the victim. Lloyd, supra at 869-70. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Leonard unlawfully possessed the items. Pitner, supra. The fact finder could have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Leonard unlawfully possessed those items where the record shows Leonard was left unsupervised in the Travis house, the items were taken from an area Leonard was specifically prohibited from accessing, Leonard did not have permission to possess the items, and Leonard was found in possession of the items later that same day. Accordingly, this claim is meritless. In his third issue, Leonard contends that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for theft by unlawful taking regarding Kessler\u2019s Geo Prizm. Specifically, Leonard contends that the Commonwealth failed to show that he exercised unlawful control over the J-S68019-19 J-S68020-19 J-S68021-19 - 11 - vehicle12 because the eyewitness who identified Leonard driving the vehicle on the date of the accident was not credible.13 In Commonwealth v.

Furthermore, the district court did not impose an additional sentence for relator' s prior conviction in docket number 551801.

They sat at a round booth; L.K. was facing the windows while her grandmother sat facing her. Near the windows of the restaurant there were tables and chairs that were higher than the booths. S.P. said her granddaughter was often distracted during their lunch and she had to encourage her to eat. S.P. said L.K. was particularly distracted by the area behind her, where a man was seated near the window. This man was later identified as Howell.\n\nAs S.P. left with L.K., the child told her that \u201c[Howell\u2019s] pee-pee was out of his pants.\u201d Shortly after returning home, L.K. drew a picture of what she saw. She later recreated a similar drawing for a detective. Surveillance video from the restaurant was given to the police and still images show Howell exposing his penis to L.K. The video also shows Howell repeatedly reach between his legs and manipulate his genitals while L.K. looks in his direction. A detective interviewed Howell who admitted he was at the restaurant, had seen L.K., but did not remember exposing himself. However, Howell did not deny exposing himself when pressed. The State charged Howell with sexual abuse of a minor by causing L.K. to witness him rubbing his genitals.",

Sexual conduct means human masturbation or any touching of the genitals or pubic areas. I.C. \u00a7 18-1506(4). When Howell motioned the district court for judgment of acquittal, the district court was tasked with assessing whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction to support the verdict. Evidence is sufficient if there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

L.K. confirmed she saw Howell\u2019s genitals but denied having seen him touch or rub the area. She also denied seeing him open and close his legs in order to hide his genitals from other customers in the restaurant but when pressed clarified that she did not remember.

BACKGROUND \u00b6 4\n\nBased upon information received by the Livingston County Sheriff\u2019s Department, an investigator with the sheriff\u2019s office went to defendant\u2019s residence in December 2013 to conduct a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d wherein the officer sought to engage the resident in a conversation to determine whether he was willing to consent to a search of the residence. Upon his arrival, defendant answered the door, acknowledged it was his residence, and ultimately admitted to growing cannabis, leading the investigator to an elaborate \u201ccannabis grow\u201d in his basement. \u00b6 5\n\nThe investigator, who then called for additional deputies, found 53 smaller cannabis plants in varying stages of growth, along with 58 larger plants at different growth stages. The growing area, which the investigator described as being \u201creally expensive,\u201d contained chrome-colored walls to reflect light from \u201calmost like suntanning bulbs,\u201d attached to timers. There were also \u201chuge Co2 can[n]isters\u201d of carbon dioxide, which were pumped into the growing areas to accelerate plant growth at various stages. They also found fans and a filtered ventilation system intended to prevent the smell of cannabis from extending beyond the basement. Based upon the investigator\u2019s knowledge and experience with \u201ccannabis grows,\u201d these things were all evidence of an elaborate cannabis production operation for profit. \u00b6 6",

Robert Ellingsworth sued Vermeer Manufacturing Company in Missouri state court, claiming he was injured while operating a Vermeer wood chipper. Vermeer removed the case and the district court1 denied Ellingsworth\u2019s motions to remand and for leave to amend and granted summary judgment to Vermeer. We affirm each of those rulings. I. Ellingsworth, an employee of Vaught Tree Service, was injured on the job in February 2014. He was feeding a small tree into a Vermeer-manufactured wood chipper using a winch attached to the chipper when the winch line became entangled in the tree\u2019s branches. The line was drawn into the chipper and then shot back out, seriously injuring Ellingsworth\u2019s legs. Ellingsworth filed this action in Missouri state court. As relevant here, he alleged products liability and failure to warn claims under both strict liability and negligence theories. He also brought claims against his supervisor at Vaught, Dwayne Marshall, alleging Marshall increased the danger posed by the wood chipper on the job site. Vermeer, an Iowa citizen, removed the case to federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction. Ellingsworth, a Missouri citizen, moved to remand, arguing there was no complete diversity because Marshall was also a Missouri citizen. The district court denied the motion, finding that Marshall was fraudulently joined because Ellingsworth had no cause of action against him. Shortly",

Based on several parts invoices turned up in discovery, Ellingsworth believed that the winch had been constructed by Vermeer Sales of Oklahoma, a Vermeer dealership.2 Ellingsworth amended his complaint to add Vermeer Oklahoma as a defendant. However, Vermeer Oklahoma was defunct and never answered the complaint. Ellingsworth voluntarily dismissed it from the case after he determined it was essentially unreachable. With no way to bring Vermeer Oklahoma into the case, Ellingsworth moved to amend his complaint to add a claim for agency liability against Vermeer to hold it liable for the actions of its dealer. The district court denied that motion because the time to amend the complaint under the scheduling order had passed and Ellingsworth could not show \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay.

Here, 2 If true, Vermeer Oklahoma violated its dealer agreement, which prohibited it from modifying Vermeer products or manufacturing parts. -3after the district court denied the motion to remand, Ellingsworth voluntarily dismissed the only nondiverse party (Marshall) then in the case. When judgment was entered, there was complete diversity among the parties. Even assuming the district court erred, under Caterpillar Ellingsworth cannot get the relief he wants. To avoid this conclusion, Ellingsworth attempts to confine Caterpillar to cases in which federal proceedings have carried on for an unusually long time or culminated in a jury trial.

Ellingsworth admits that his real reason for pressing the agency claim belatedly was his realization that he had no other way to hold Vermeer Oklahoma liable for allegedly building and installing the winch. His attempted addition of the claim had more to do with a change in litigation strategy than in the factual or legal basis of his case. That is not sufficient to establish good cause and the district court was well within its discretion to deny the motion. IV. Finally, Ellingsworth claims that the district court erred in granting Vermeer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his products liability and failure to warn claims. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if the record shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Junk, 628 F.3d at 450. On appeal, Ellingsworth makes clear that his remaining claims against Vermeer for both products liability and failure to warn only concern the winch attachment to the wood chipper, not the wood chipper itself. Under Missouri law, both strict liability and negligence versions of these claims require that the defendant manufactured or sold the product causing injury. Johnson v.

That element is fatal to Ellingsworth\u2019s case. -5The record shows that Vermeer did not manufacture the winch attachment that injured Ellingsworth. It is uncontested that Vermeer offers no after-market winch attachments for sale and that the wood chipper that injured Ellingsworth did not have a winch when Vermeer manufactured it. At most, the evidence suggests that the winch was constructed by a third party out of mostly Vermeer parts, but Ellingsworth\u2019s suit is not about the quality of the winch parts. He alleges that Vermeer manufactured the winch itself. Because the record forecloses that argument, the district court correctly granted Vermeer summary judgment.

But the State elected to initiate the habitual offender status process under \u00a7 4214(b) following Brown\u2019s 2013 jury trial.

As for Brown\u2019s 2013 sentence, Brown raised no objection to the Superior Court sentencing him on the same day it considered the State\u2019s habitual offender motion, nor did he file a timely motion for the correction of a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within ninety days of the imposition of the sentence.11 Accordingly, Brown may not object to court\u2019s failure to hold a separate hearing on the State\u2019s motion to declare him an habitual offender now.

He has also filed two motions for a stay of the district court\u2019s judgment pending the disposition of the petitions. We conclude that Hill is not entitled to relief. Mandamus relief is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976); United States v. Moussaoui, 333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir. 2003). Further, mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. In re Braxton, 258 F.3d 250, 261 (4th Cir. 2001). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. In re Lockheed Martin Corp., 503 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir. 2007). Similarly, a writ of prohibition \u201cis a drastic and extraordinary remedy which should be granted only when the petitioner has shown his right to the writ to be clear and undisputable and that the actions of the court were a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d In re Vargas, 723 F.2d 1461, 1468 (10th Cir. 1983). A writ of prohibition also may not be used as a substitute for appeal. Id. Hill can seek the requested relief in an appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment, and indeed, such an appeal is currently pending before this court. See United States v. Hill, No. 19-4758.* Accordingly, we deny the petition for writs of mandamus and",

He was held in county jail and charged with state offenses. On August 24, 2016, he was indicted on a federal charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The state offenses, which were based on the same conduct as the federal charge, were later dismissed. On August 30, 2016, Goodface was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals Service (\u201cUSMS\u201d) pursuant to a federal writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. He remained in the physical custody of USMS from August 30, 2016 to February 21, 2018. Goodface pled guilty in federal court to the firearms charge. On February 22, 2018, he was sentenced to a 28-month federal term of imprisonment and began serving his federal sentence that day. His judgment and sentence recommended that he be given credit for time served.

On March 28, 2018, the Colorado State Board of Parole revoked Goodface\u2019s state parole sentence. The Colorado Department of Corrections (\u201cCDOC\u201d) granted him credit against his parole sentence for the entire period he was \u201con the streets\u201d from March 22, 2016 (when he was released from prison) to March 28, 2018 (when his parole was revoked). But Goodface also sought presentence confinement credit against his federal sentence for the time period when he was in USMS custody prior to receiving his federal sentence, from August 30, 2016 to February 21, 2018. After the federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) denied him that requested credit, he filed this petition.1 II In computing a federal sentence, we follow a two-step process: we first determine the commencement date of the federal sentence, then address whether the defendant can receive credit for time spent in custody prior to the commencement of that sentence. Binford v. United States, 436 F.3d 1252, 1254 (10th Cir. 2006). The district court concluded the BOP correctly determined that Goodface began serving his federal sentence on February 22, 2018.

Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant is entitled to \u201ccredit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences,\u201d but only if that time \u201chas not been credited against another sentence.\u201d In enacting \u00a7 3585(b), \u201cCongress made clear that a defendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time.\u201d Wilson, 503 U.S. at 337. Goodface argues the credit he received against his Colorado sentence was for time Colorado considered him to be \u201con the streets,\u201d which he would have received for being on parole regardless of whether he served that time in BOP custody.2 The credit the CDOC granted him, he contends, was therefore not due to his being in official detention and should not count as a credit against his state sentence for purposes of \u00a7 3585(b).

Alternatively, if \u00a7 3585(b) is ambiguous, Goodface contends we should look to the purpose of the provision, which is to ensure that defendants do not receive duplicative credit due to time spent in official detention. We agree with the district court that Goodface is not entitled to further credit against his federal sentence. He has already received credit toward his state sentence for time spent in official detention from August 30, 2016 to February 21, 2018, prior to the commencement of his federal sentence on February 22, 2018. The fact that Colorado would have afforded him the same credit for serving a term of parole in the community is irrelevant. The time Goodface spent in official detention was credited against his state sentence. That is all the statute\u2019s plain language requires. Goodface also notes that \u00a7 3585(b) makes no reference to credit granted toward a term of parole. But under Colorado law, \u201cthe term \u2018sentence\u2019 incorporates both the incarceration component and the mandatory parole component of an offender\u2019s penalty.\u201d People v. Norton, 63 P.3d 339, 344 (Colo. 2003). Goodface does not contest this principle of Colorado law.

Pursuant to a plea agreement, Whitecotton pled guilty to unlawful possession of a firearm. In exchange for his plea, the State agreed to dismiss misdemeanor charges in other cases pending against Whitecotton. However, Whitecotton failed to appear for sentencing. He was eventually arrested, and his sentencing hearing was rescheduled. During his rescheduled sentencing hearing, Whitecotton moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court granted the motion and set the matter for a jury trial. A jury found Whitecotton guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm. Whitecotton subsequently moved for reconsideration of his sentence under I.C.R. 35. After holding a hearing, the district court denied the motion. Whitecotton appeals. II.

A sentence of confinement is reasonable if it appears at the time of sentencing that confinement is necessary to accomplish the primary objective of protecting society and to achieve any or all of the related goals of deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution applicable to a given case. State v. Toohill, 103 Idaho 565, 568, 650 P.2d 707, 710 (Ct. App. 1982).

Specifically, Whitecotton asserts that, by failing to identify what specific criminal offense the officer conducting the investigative detention had reasonable suspicion to investigate, the district court applied the incorrect legal standard to determine whether the investigative detention was lawful and that, according to the correct standard, insufficient reasonable suspicion existed for an investigative detention.

We reject Whitecotton\u2019s assertion that the district court erred by failing to identify a specific criminal offense related to Whitecotton\u2019s conduct. This Court has previously rejected the argument that reasonable suspicion requires specific criminal activity. In State v. Perez-Jungo, 156 Idaho 609, 615, 329 P.3d 391, 397 (Ct. App. 2014), we held that reasonable suspicion does not require a belief that any specific criminal activity is afoot to justify an investigative detention. Rather, all that is required is a showing of objective and specific articulable facts giving reason to believe that the individual has been or is about to be involved in some criminal activity. Id.

Arvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 272 (2002) (noting that the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer\u2019s action is supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot); Brown v.

    "content": "The United States Supreme Court elaborated on the meaning of reasonable suspicion in Cortez, 449 U.S. at 417. The Court explained:\n\nThe opinion in Gonzales was issued after this case was submitted on the briefs.\n\nThe idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a particularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present before a stop is permissible. First, the assessment must be based upon all the circumstances. The analysis proceeds with various objective observations, information from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions--inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person.\n\nThe process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same--and so are law enforcement officers. Finally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.",

Specifically, Whitecotton argues, based upon a single statement by the district court during a hearing on a motion seeking a sentence reduction, that the district court failed to act according to applicable legal standards because it considered the fact that Whitecotton exercised his constitutional right to a jury trial. The State responds that, when taken in context, the district court\u2019s allegedly improper statement does not indicate that Whitecotton was being punished for exercising a constitutional right. The State further argues that, even if the district court improperly considered Whitecotton\u2019s demand for a jury trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion because Whitecotton\u2019s sentence is supported by other proper rationales.\n\nIt is improper for a court to penalize a defendant merely because he or she exercises the right to put the government to its proof at trial.

The statement arose in the midst of the following larger discussion of Whitecotton\u2019s lack of cooperation with the justice system: Looking at whether or not further leniency with regard to the fixed sentence, [Whitecotton] had previously pled guilty, and we were set for sentencing, and [he] then just determined in his mind that he was not going to appear for sentencing, and so then we had to have him arrested, and then he withdrew his plea, and he had his opportunity to go to trial.

The three-year indeterminate sentence, I would hope that he would be able to parole and be a productive citizen here in either Idaho or Oregon, but I think that would be the idea behind rehabilitation for him. So considering those goals of sentencing, I think the two-year fixed, three years indeterminate sentence was appropriate under the circumstances. And so, based on that, the Court is going to deny the Rule 35 motion. (Emphasis added.) In context, the statement upon which Whitecotton relies is more properly interpreted as an observation by the district court that Whitecotton\u2019s conduct demonstrated his belief that he did not have to comply with the court\u2019s orders and that he did not accept responsibility for his conduct. The district court noted that Whitecotton had a history of similar behavior. The court could consider such factors when fashioning a sentence. See Brown, 131 Idaho at 73, 951 P.2d at 1300 (observing that a court can consider the failure to accept responsibility in relation to a defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation). The district court\u2019s single statement regarding Whitecotton\u2019s exercise of his right to a jury trial does not establish that his sentence violates applicable legal standards.8 Therefore, Whitecotton has failed to show that his sentence constitutes an abuse of discretion.

For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court to the extent of our jurisdiction, see 3d Cir.

Wilmington Savings Fund Society (\u201cWSFS\u201d) filed an action in state court over a dispute with Velardi regarding the fee simple ownership of real property located in Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania, following a foreclosure sale. Velardi removed the action to the District Court, citing Public Law 39-26, a predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 that allowed for removal \u201cfor any cause whatsoever\u201d related to violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

On WSFS\u2019s timely motion, and upon adopting the report and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court remanded the matter to state court because Velardi did not state proper grounds for removal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 and because the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case. This Court\u2019s jurisdiction over district court orders remanding removed cases to state court is constrained by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which states that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed",

Chochaev previously petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s order affirming the denial of his motion to reopen his removal order; a panel of this Court dismissed that petition in part and denied it in part. See Chochaev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 783 F. App\u2019x 967, 968 (11th Cir. 2019). Chochaev\u2019s present petition raises four arguments. First, he asserts that the BIA erred by rejecting his argument that his serious illness and his prior attorneys\u2019 ineffective assistance amounted to exceptional circumstances that excused his failure to appear at his removal hearing, rendering his in absentia order of removal inappropriate. Second, he contends that the BIA erred by ignoring In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253 (B.I.A. 2002), overruled on other grounds by Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. 688 (B.I.A. 2012), in its decision declining to reopen his proceedings based on his marriage to a lawful permanent resident (LPR) and his pending visa petition. Third, he argues that the BIA erred in declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his case. Finally, Chochaev",

Moreover, even if we were to treat the petition as timely filed, the reasoning of Velarde-Pacheco still wouldn\u2019t support Chochaev\u2019s argument, for the reasons explained below.\n\n4 It\u2019s worth noting that the BIA appears to mistakenly assert that Chochaev\u2019s spouse was already a U.S. citizen in its order.

See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2), (e)(1), (3). Chochaev has presented no evidence that, despite these statutory barriers, he would have been able to get a visa immediately once his petition was approved.

Appellant\u2019s appointed counsel filed a brief in which he concludes the appeal is wholly frivolous and without merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record and demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced. See High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 811\u201313 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). A copy of counsel\u2019s brief was delivered to appellant. Appellant was advised of the right to examine the appellate record and file a pro se response. See Stafford\n\nv. State, 813 S.W.2d 503, 512 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). As of this date, more than 60 days have passed and no pro se response has been filed. We have carefully reviewed the record and counsel\u2019s brief and agree the appeal is wholly frivolous and without merit. Further, we find no reversible error in the record. We are not to address the merits of each claim raised in an Anders brief or a pro se response when we have determined there are no arguable grounds for review. See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 827\u201328 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Accordingly, the order of the trial court is affirmed.",

The trial court issued an order denying his section 5-9-2 motion, and defendant appealed. \u00b6 3 In September 2019, OSAD filed a motion to withdraw.

After determining that Wade qualified for sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), the district court sentenced Wade to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Wade appeals, contending the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it found, for ACCA purposes, that Wade had committed two previous offenses charged in a single indictment on occasions different from one another. Wade claims that under the Sixth Amendment this was a fact for a jury to find. Because this argument is foreclosed by our precedent, we affirm. On October 2, 2018, Wade pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated that because Wade had three previous drug-related convictions, he qualified for a sentencing enhancement under ACCA. One conviction was for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of Missouri law. The other two were federal convictions for distribution of cocaine. The federal charges were brought in the same indictment, which, along with the plea agreement in that case, made clear that Wade had engaged in the conduct underlying one of the charges on February 24, 2012, and the conduct underlying the other charge on October 5, 2012. The district court rejected Wade\u2019s argument that his Missouri state conviction did not",

Although Barrientos-Lopez submitted evidence of how Latinos in the United States and Latin America perceive persons with mental illness, nothing in the record or in the BIA\u2019s decision demonstrates that the BIA mischaracterized or misinterpreted the submitted evidence. Further, the evidence does not compel a conclusion that Mexican society perceives persons with mental illness as a distinct group. See id. at 1137-38. Accordingly, because Barrientos-Lopez has failed to establish a cognizable social group, he has not met his burden of establishing eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal. See Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003). 3.

The parties agreed to settle the case for $75,000, but disputes arose concerning other settlement terms. Sanchez-Garcia moved to enforce the settlement. The District Court granted the motion and the United States sent the settlement check to Sanchez-Garcia. An appeal bearing Sanchez-Garcia\u2019s name was filed, but the brief in support of the appeal raises issues that impact only Sanchez-Garcia\u2019s counsel (\u201cCounsel\u201d). Because Sanchez-Garcia has not been injured by the order enforcing the settlement, and because the notice of appeal fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c), we will dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. I Sanchez-Garcia slipped and fell at a United States Post Office and brought an FTCA action against the United States. The United States filed a third-party complaint against the building\u2019s landlord, Tacony 19135, LLC, and the City of Philadelphia. The parties agreed to settle the case, but counsel for the parties could not agree on: (1) language related to the responsibility for taxes; (2) whether Counsel needed to sign the\n\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7, does not constitute binding precedent.",

Admin. 6.2(a) (providing 180 days for court\u2019s final disposition). The accelerated schedule requires greater compliance with briefing deadlines. Therefore, we order Nathan H. Butler to file appellant\u2019s brief no later than February 25, 2020. If the brief is not filed by that date, counsel may be required to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. It is ordered on February 11, 2020.\n\nBefore Justices Goodwin, Kelly, and Smith",

The trial court stated on the record that an aggravated-range sentence on the involuntary manslaughter count was justified because Mulkin delivered drugs he knew to have recently caused others to overdose,8 and because Mulkin had previously been caught with controlled substances while incarcerated for drug possession. ____________________________________________ 5 Furanylfentanyl is a derivative of the synthetic opioid, Fentanyl. N.T. Trial, 6/20/19, at 200-23. Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and furanylfentanyl is slightly less potent than Fentanyl.

See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a). 7 For sentencing purposes, Mulkin\u2019s conviction for delivery of a controlled substance merged delivery of a designer drug. 8 In May of 2016, Mulkin purchased several baggies of furanylfentanyl, which he thought contained heroin, for himself and Whitesell.

At the time of purchase, Mulkin was told that other drug users had recently overdosed after ingesting that particular batch of drugs. Id. at 121. J-S68026-19 - 3 - On April 18, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely motion to modify sentence which the trial court denied on May 2, 2019. On May 11, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely notice of appeal followed by a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise statement of errors complained of on appeal. He presents the following issue for our consideration: \u201cDid the [s]entencing [c]ourt abuse [its] discretion by relying on inappropriate factors and by ignoring mitigating evidence when it aggravated [Mulkin\u2019s] sentence beyond the standard range?\u201d Brief for Appellant, at 5. Mulkin\u2019s claim represents a challenge to the discretionary aspects of his sentence. Commonwealth v. Prestidge, 539 A.2d 439, 441 (Pa. Super. 1988). An appeal raising the discretionary aspects of sentencing is not guaranteed as of right; rather, it is considered a petition for permission to appeal. Commonwealth v. Williams, 562 A.2d 1385, 1386-87 (Pa. Super. 1989) (en banc). In order to reach the merits of a discretionary aspects claim, we must engage in a four-part analysis to determine: (1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see Pa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly preserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify sentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P.

N.T. Sentencing, 4/10/19, at 35.

PER CURIAM: Russell Todd Mathis was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and aiding and abetting the possession with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii). He was sentenced to life in prison and now appeals his convictions and sentence. With respect to his convictions, he argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. With respect to his sentence, he argues that the district court erred in considering acquitted conduct during sentencing, or alternatively, that the district court erred by concluding that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed a dangerous weapon for purposes of an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We reject his arguments and affirm. I We review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency grounds. United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir. 2007). We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d Id.

Silvestri, 409 F.3d 1311, 1328 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, the government presented ample evidence for a reasonable jury to convict Mathis of conspiracy. Walter Williams testified that Mathis routinely purchased methamphetamine from him in increasingly large quantities. This was corroborated by evidence\u2014from a roving wiretap targeting Williams\u2014of numerous texts and calls indicating drug transactions between Williams and Mathis. Williams testified that when Mathis got in trouble and was required to wear an ankle monitor, he would send his girlfriend, Elizabeth Gallaher, to pick up the drugs. Moreover, Dana Stokes and Ashley Shaw both testified that Mathis purchased large quantities of methamphetamine from Williams and worked with others to distribute it. Williams, Shaw, and Stokes, each identified purchases or sales of methamphetamines by Mathis that jury could reasonably conclude amounted to participation or facilitation of the conspiracy. Additionally, three large quantities of methamphetamine seized in the course of the investigation had a nexus to Mathis. First, a significant quantity of methamphetamine and a firearm were found in the car of Elizabeth Gallaher, with text messages from the wiretap and phone call recordings from the jail",

III We also reject the challenge to Mathis\u2019s sentence. Mathis argues that the district court improperly considered acquitted conduct when it found, for sentencing purposes, that he possessed a firearm. He makes two alternative arguments on this point. First, he argues that because the jury acquitted him of the possession of a firearm and the related drug offense, the district court improperly considered the firearm at sentencing. Second, he argues\u2014in a single sentence with no elaboration\u2014that the \u201ctrial court erred in finding, by preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Mathis possessed a firearm.\u201d We can reject his first argument based on clear precedent. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that the sentencing court may consider any fact for which a defendant has been acquitted as long as the Government proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, the occurrence of that conduct and as long as the enhancement results in a sentence below the maximum statutory penalty authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Maddox, 803 F.3d at 1220.

Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243, 245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009).

In short, reasonable efforts are an ongoing consideration throughout the child protection case.1 Although Doe contends that Idaho\u2019s treatment of the federal reasonable efforts requirement \u201carguably\u201d jeopardizes federal subsidies for foster care, she does not present any argument explaining why such funding could be at risk and her reference to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21 does not support her assertion. The applicable federal regulation only conditions foster care funding in an individual case on a judicial determination that reasonable efforts were made to prevent removal and finalize the permanency plan. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21(b) (2012); see also 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 671 (2019). As described above, the requirements attendant to the child protection proceedings include reasonable efforts throughout.2 The Department\u2019s reasonable efforts, and a magistrate court\u2019s findings regarding reasonable efforts, are subject to appellate review.

This preference does not, however, implicate due process. Moreover, it is contrary to the statutory scheme enacted by the legislature.

Such considerations may include concerns for permanency and stability for the child. See I.C. \u00a7 16-1622(2)(g) (requiring the Department to file a petition to terminate parental rights once the child has been in the temporary or legal custody of the Department for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(C) (2019) (providing that, if continuation of reasonable efforts at reunification is inconsistent with the permanency plan for the child, reasonable efforts should be made to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan and complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize permanent placement).

The Idaho Supreme Court recently reaffirmed this principle in In re Doe, 164 Idaho 883, 889, 436 P.3d 1232, 1238 (2019) and rejected an assertion, similar to Doe\u2019s, that this principle violates due process. Id. at 889-90, 436 P.3d at 1238-39. Doe has failed to identify any due process flaw in when or how the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts are considered and reviewed in Idaho.",

Statutory basis Doe argues that moving her child out of state made it impossible for her to complete \u201cimportant and significant portions\u201d of her case plan making it improper to terminate her parental rights for failure to do so. We hold that the magistrate court\u2019s determination that Doe neglected her child was supported by clear and convincing evidence. A parent has a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining a relationship with his or her child. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); Doe v. State, 137 Idaho 758, 760, 53 P.3d 341, 343 (2002). This interest is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. State v. Doe, 144 Idaho 839, 842, 172 P.3d 1114, 1117 (2007). Implicit in the Termination of Parent and Child Relationship Act is the philosophy that, wherever possible, family life should be strengthened and preserved. I.C. \u00a7 16-2001(2). Therefore, the requisites of due process must be met when terminating the parent-child relationship. State v. Doe, 143 Idaho 383, 386, 146 P.3d 649, 652 (2006). Due process requires that the grounds for terminating a parent-child relationship be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Id. Because a fundamental liberty interest is at stake, the United States Supreme Court has determined that a court may terminate a parent-child relationship only if that decision is supported by clear and convincing evidence.

Specifically, Doe argues that her efforts to accomplish two \u201cimportant tasks\u201d in her case plan \u201cwere utterly frustrated\u201d when the child was moved out of state. The two tasks Doe identifies as impossible to complete are Task 1.1.1.5 (which required her to participate in regular visits with the child in order to create healthy attachments and implement proper parenting techniques) and Task 1.1.1.6 (which required Doe to demonstrate an ability to provide for the child\u2019s basic developmental, medical, and other needs). However, the magistrate court found that, while moving the child out of state presented difficulties, those difficulties were not insurmountable.

Prior convictions are initially used to determine whether any statutory enhancements apply. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2; see also United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 758\u201359 (1997). Then, depending on the applicable statutory maximum, the career-offender Guideline kicks in to reveal an offender\u2019s base offense level. Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1) (applying an offense level of 37 when the statutory maximum is \u201c[l]ife\u201d), with id. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(2) (applying an offense level of 34 when the statutory maximum is \u201c25 years or more\u201d). The point is that, far from prohibiting a single conviction from \u201ccounting\u201d in both calculations, the text of the careeroffender Guideline all but says that it does. See id. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2.\n\nSecond, to the extent Snow\u2019s argument is independent of the text of these provisions, our decision in United States v.

In the face of a Sixth Amendment challenge, we concluded that doing so created \u201cno legal error.\u201d Id. Although the nature of the challenge in this case is different, any error in using Snow\u2019s prior conviction for both purposes would, at a minimum, not be \u201cclear or obvious under\u201d Quiroga.

    "content": "According to Snow, applying Setser here would be a bridge too far because there was no telling whether Iowa would actually seek to revoke his parole. It is true that revocation proceedings had already begun in Setser by the time the district court decided to order consecutive sentences. Id. at 233. Still, we do not believe this distinction matters. After all, the dividing line, according to the Supreme Court, is whether a state sentence is \u201canticipate[d],\u201d not whether formal proceedings have started. Id. at 236.\n\nIn this case, the district court anticipated that Iowa would seek a prison sentence. It knew that Snow was on parole for prior drug crimes, identified the relevant Iowa cases by docket number, and familiarized itself with his criminal history and the facts underlying his most recent drug offense. It was no stretch to conclude that Snow\u2019s commission of another serious drug crime while on parole would conceivably lead to more prison time in Iowa. See Iowa Code \u00a7 908.5(1); see also Rhiner v. State, 703 N.W.2d 174, 177 (Iowa 2005) (describing Iowa\u2019s parolerevocation procedures); Iowa Admin. Code r. 201-45.2(1) (requiring, as a standard condition of parole, that a parolee \u201cobey all laws and ordinances\u201d). These facts place this case squarely within Setser\u2019s domain.\n\nIII.\n\nWe accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court. ______________________________",

As noted by Milano, if appellant intended for the auto exclusion in the UP to apply to claims alleging negligent supervision, hiring, employment, training, or monitoring of others by the insured, it could have expressly included such a clause in the UP, just as it did for the aircraft and watercraft exclusion in the UP and the exclusion relating to aircraft, auto, and watercraft in the CGL policy.

Based on this testimony, Nevarez argues A.N.\u2019s description that Nevarez touched \u201cthe top of my private\u201d does not mean Nevarez touched her \u201cprivate\u201d and that A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram resolves \u201cany ambiguity\u201d by showing that Nevarez only touched A.N.\u2019s \u201clower abdomen\u201d and not her \u201cupper external genitalia.\u201d The State argues that A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram shows Nevarez touched A.N.\u2019s \u201cmons pubis,\u201d which Nevarez concedes is part of the female genitalia. We agree with the State. The Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford v. State, 160 Idaho 586, 595, 377 P.3d 400, 409 (2016), is instructive. In Crawford, the State charged Crawford with lewd conduct with a minor under sixteen, alleging manual-to-genital contact. Id. at 589, 377 P.3d at 403. At trial, the victim testified Crawford touched the \u201c[o]utside of [her] vaginal area.\u201d Id. at 590, 377 P.3d at 404. On appeal from the dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief, Crawford argued there was insufficient evident to support his conviction because the phrase \u201coutside of [the victim\u2019s] vaginal area\u201d \u201ccould not reasonably be interpreted to constitute manual-genital contact.\u201d Id. at 595, 377 P.3d 409.

    "content": "Just as in Crawford, A.N.\u2019s testimony in this case that Nevarez touched \u201cthe top of [her] private\u201d may mean that Nevarez touched her external genitalia. To the extent the phrase \u201cthe top of [her] private\u201d is ambiguous, the jury\u2019s province was to determine what A.N. meant by the phrase, and we will not substitute our view for that of the jury as to the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. See State v. Neyhart, 160 Idaho 746, 751, 378 P.3d 1045, 1050 (Ct. App. 2016) (ruling determining what victim meant by \u201cprivate\u201d was within jury\u2019s province). Moreover, A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram of the unclothed girl does not support Nevarez\u2019s claim that he only \u201ctouched A.N.\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201d To the contrary, the marking tends to support the opposite, showing A.N. indicated Nevarez touched the mons pubis, which is part of the female external genitalia, as Nevarez concedes. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found the State sustained its burden beyond a reasonable doubt of proving manual-to-genital contact. See Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho at 385, 957 P.2d at 1101 (ruling court will not overturn judgment of conviction supported by substantial evidence upon which reasonable trier of fact could have found burden sustained beyond reasonable doubt).

The district court denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion, determining the Information adequately informed Ms. Zayas of the recklessness requirement and that Ms. Zayas had admitted facts consistent with that requirement in her plea agreement. Because nothing in the record informed Ms. Zayas that the government would be required to prove that she knew, rather than merely should have known, of the risk, we conclude her plea was not knowing and voluntary and reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw.1",

On October 22, 2007, Ms. Zayas found her two-month-old daughter, Annalicia Zayas, unresponsive thirty minutes after putting Annalicia down for a nap. An autopsy showed Annalicia had suffered multiple skull fractures, hemorrhages, and scalp contusions within two to three hours of her death. The autopsy also revealed Annalicia had ten rib fractures in various stages of healing; healing fractures to her right wrist bones; and lesions on her body, consistent with cigarette burns, some of which were healing. The medical examiner ruled Annalicia\u2019s death a homicide. On April 24, 2012, a grand jury indicted Ms. Zayas, charging her with various violations of New Mexico law under the Assimilated Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 13.2 Ms. Zayas was arrested that same day.

I disregarded that risk, and I was wholly indifferent to the consequences of the conduct and to the welfare and safety of my daughter, Annalicia Zayas.\n\nMy actions resulted in great bodily harm to Annalicia.\n\nSpecifically, as a result of my actions, my daughter sustained the following injuries between August 16, 2007 through October 22, 2007, that constitute great bodily harm:\n\n3 The Information did not charge Ms. Zayas with abusing Annalicia, rather, it charged Ms. Zayas with failing to protect Annalicia. Ms. Zayas has maintained that her codefendant and husband, Peter Zayas, was responsible for inflicting the injuries that caused Annalicia\u2019s death. Although Mr. Zayas made inconsistent statements regarding who was responsible for Annalicia\u2019s death, on at least two occasions he claimed sole responsibility for Annalicia\u2019s injuries.",

But -- and even though I have that -- that -- that conviction in me and that\u2019s what has -- that along with my knowing that she was not murdered, has kept me fighting all of this [sic] years. But when the language says that I should have known . . . my language used -- I used to say how could I? If I had known, I would have . . . I would have helped my child, I would have seen. I would have -- if I had known . . . things could be different. But I didn\u2019t. But the language says that I should have known because I am her parent. She\u2019s alive. And that -- that -- the -- the gross -- the injuries and how they have -- could have occurred, even if accidental, was still negligent because it wasn\u2019t addressed. And so, although I never intended for Anna to be hurt, although I had another child afterwards and raised her with no injuries, I cannot deny that these injuries were, indeed, found. So -- so I hurt for her. I wish I could have known, but I . . . and I should have known, because I\u2019m her mommy. And so that\u2019s how I\u2019ve been able to -- the language is hard to stomach. It always",

As relevant to this appeal, Ms. Zayas argued she should be permitted to withdraw her plea because the district court failed to adequately explain the nature of the charge, including the recklessness mens rea requirement. Concluding that the Information adequately informed Ms. Zayas of the recklessness requirement and that the admission of facts in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea agreement satisfied this requirement, the district court denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea on February 8, 2017. In December 2017, Ms. Zayas filed a motion to reconsider the denial of her motion to withdraw her guilty plea on unrelated grounds. At the hearing on the motion to reconsider, the district court sua sponte raised the concern that the court had not sufficiently explained the elements of the charge to Ms. Zayas during the plea colloquy. After receiving additional briefing on this matter, the district court concluded the language in the plea agreement put Ms. Zayas on notice that she was pleading guilty to a crime with a recklessness mens rea and denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to reconsider. On September 28, 2018, the district court entered judgment, sentencing Ms. Zayas to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ms. Zayas timely filed a notice of appeal. B.

Turning now to the plea agreement, we conclude it likewise fails to evidence Ms. Zayas\u2019s understanding that recklessness was required.

There is nothing in the Information or the plea agreement indicating the government would be required to prove that Ms. Zayas knew rather than should have known of the risk. In fact, at the time of Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea, the government would not have been required to prove more than criminal negligence. The use of \u201cshould have known\u201d in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea agreement and the plea colloquy was not superfluous to the other reckless disregard language; it was an alternative basis for guilt. The should-have-known language in the plea agreement allowed the government to prove negligence when the defendant disregarded a risk of which she should have known. Later developments in New Mexico law make it clear that the should-have-known standard is no longer good law. And Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea colloquy emphatically confirms that she believed the government could prove its case because she should have known of the risk. In sum, the record reflects that Ms. Zayas was not aware of the specific requirements of the recklessness element\u2014that she consciously disregarded a known risk. There is nothing in the Information, plea agreement, or plea colloquy that would support the conclusion that Ms. Zayas received notice of the recklessness mens rea requirement from another source. Indeed, the Information that sets forth the criminal charge to which she pleaded guilty states only a negligence mens rea. Upon this",

According to the State, as Adamidis approached Anderson\u2019s car, he saw Anderson reach towards the gearshift. Anticipating Anderson would drive away, Adamidis said, \u201cTrevor, don\u2019t do it.\u201d The State argued the statement showed Anderson\u2019s willfulness in fleeing and did not fall within the hearsay exception because it merely involved a \u201cstatement of direction.\u201d At the hearing on the motion, the State added that the statement constituted an excited utterance and did not contain an \u201cassertion of fact.\u201d Anderson objected, contending that the statement qualifies as hearsay and identified Anderson as the offender, which would bolster Adamidis\u2019s in-court testimony that he curbed the car because he recognized Anderson.

This qualifies the statement as admissible under Illinois Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015). \u00b6 30 Anderson also contends that the prosecutor committed reversible error in closing argument by repeating the out-of-court statement as proof of Anderson\u2019s identity as the offender. Anderson asserts that because the statement was not an excited utterance, it was only admissible to show that Anderson willfully ignored Adamidis\u2019s command, but the State used it to bolster the officers\u2019 testimony that Anderson drove the sedan. According to Anderson, the closeness of the evidence makes this highly prejudicial as evidenced by the jury sending the court two notes. But the statement not amounting to hearsay means that the prosecutor could refer to it in closing argument. See People v. Reed, 108 Ill. App. 3d 984, 993 (1982) (prosecutor\u2019s reference to properly admitted exhibit in closing argument was proper). \u00b6 31 Finally, there being no error, we need not discuss Anderson\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness for his counsel\u2019s failing (i) to object during closing arguments to the State\u2019s reference to Adamidis\u2019s statement and (ii) to include the issue in a posttrial motion.

The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2018). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2018). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. See Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773-74 (2017). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a constitutional right. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140-41 (2012) (citing Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Johns has not made the requisite showing.* Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process. DISMISSED",

PennyMac was a party to the prior proceeding; identical arbitration agreements were at issue; the parties vigorously litigated whether the agreements contained unenforceable PAGA waivers and whether those waivers were severable; the Court of Appeal expressly decided those issues; and its decision is final on appeal. PennyMac argues that the issues here differ from those decided in Smigelski because the employees here assert claims under federal law. We disagree. The Court of Appeal in Smigelski held that the severability provisions of PennyMac\u2019s arbitration agreement prohibited severance of provisions found to violate state law. See 2018 WL 6629406, at *11. For that reason, the court held that the agreements were unenforceable in their entirety, not only as to PAGA claims or to claims under state law. See id. at *12. That PennyMac disagrees with the Court of Appeal\u2019s application of federal law is not a valid basis for refusing that decision full faith and credit as required by \u00a7 1738. See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, 95\u201396 (1980). The district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the employees\u2019 state-law claims for the sole reason that it had dismissed all federal claims before it. Because we reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the employees\u2019 federal claims, we also reverse as to their state-law claims. REVERSED.",

The prosecuting attorney has conceded that the trial court erred in scoring OV 17, MCL 777.47. Because correcting the OV score would change the applicable guidelines range, resentencing is required. People v Francisco, 474 Mich 82 (2006). In all other respects, leave to appeal is DENIED, because we are not persuaded that the remaining question presented should be reviewed by this Court.",

After reviewing Desmond\u2019s removal petition, the District Court determined that it appeared Desmond was attempting to remove his case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 and the removal procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455. The District Court then held that the allegations in Desmond\u2019s notice were insufficient to support removal under \u00a7 1443, denied the petition, and summarily remanded the case to the state court from which it was removed. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4) (\u201cIf it clearly appears on the face of the notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should not be permitted, the court shall make an order for summary remand.\u201d).

Governor of Delaware, 922 F.3d 166 (3d Cir. 2019), cert. granted, 2019 WL 6647103 (U.S. Dec. 6, 2019) (No. 19-309), is misplaced. In Adams, this Court held that sections of the Delaware Constitution that required the number of judges to be balanced between the two major political parties violated the First Amendment right to freedom of association. See id. at 184\u201385. Desmond appears to argue that this means he has been convicted in a proceeding presided over by a judge who had been unconstitutionally appointed. However, there is no language in Adams that implies that the judges previously appointed under Delaware\u2019s political balance requirement are unqualified to serve as judicial officers, nor did the Court give any indication that its decision was intended to support an argument that all prior Delaware convictions be vacated. Cf. Adams, 922 F.3d at 186 (McKee, J., concurring) (\u201cPraise for the Delaware judiciary is nearly universal, and it is well deserved.\u201d). As such, Desmond\u2019s Adams argument does not provide a valid basis for removal under \u00a7 1443.\n\nAccordingly, the District Court correctly determined that removal under \u00a7 1443 would not be proper and appropriately remanded Desmond\u2019s case to the state court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4).1 We will thus affirm the judgment of the District Court.",

Claudia Yanira Magana, pro se. Daniel G. Kempland, Melissa D. Lang, and Gregory Michael Hahn, for respondent. SUMMARY OPINION GOEKE, Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions of section 7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the petition was filed.1 1Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal (continued...) - 2 - Pursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by any other court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other case. Respondent determined deficiencies in income tax for 2014, 2015, and 2016 of $8,725, $7,085, and $5,890, respectively, and an accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) for each year. Respondent has conceded the accuracy-related penalties. He has also conceded that petitioner is entitled to claim two of her three children as qualifying child dependents for purposes of personal exemptions, the child tax credit, and the earned income credit for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The remaining issues are whether petitioner is entitled to head of household filing status for 2015 and 2016 and a $1,000 education credit for 2014. We find that she properly filed as head of household for 2015 and 2016. However, she has not established that she is entitled to the education credit for 2014.",

Background Petitioner was a medical assistant during 2014, 2015, and 2016. She lived with her three children and their father. She was not married to her children\u2019s father during the years at issue. She paid most of the household expenses for each year at issue but filed as head of household for only 2015 and 2016. She filed as 1(...continued) Revenue Code as amended and in effect at all relevant times, and all Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure. - 3 - single for 2014. One of petitioner\u2019s children is disabled. The children\u2019s father did not claim the three children as his dependents for the years at issue, and he did not file as head of household for 2015 and 2016. He struggled with medical debts and other personal expenses, and petitioner had a greater adjusted gross income during the years at issue. There was no written support agreement regarding the children. Petitioner was a student in 2013 and paid tuition in that year, but there is no evidence that she paid tuition in 2014. Discussion Pursuant to section 2(b), an individual is considered a head of household and thereby entitled to the section 63(c) standard deduction for this filing status if she meets certain conditions. These conditions are, in relevant part: a. she was not married at the close of the taxable year; b. she was not a",

App\u2019x 954 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (unpublished), this panel reversed the district court\u2019s decision granting Donald Duhart\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)\u2013(2). Id. at 956. The Supreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of its decision in United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019), which struck down \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague, id. at 2336. See Duhart v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 100 (2019). On remand, and in light of this Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. United States, 942 F.3d 1069 (11th Cir. 2019), Mr. Duhart\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) cannot stand. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision vacating Mr. Duhart\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) and remand with directions to resentence him on an expedited basis. I. A federal grand jury indicted Mr. Duhart and his co-conspirators with various drug, firearm, and robbery offenses. The indictment specifically charged Mr. Duhart with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 1); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)",

His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. United States v. Duhart, 379 F. App\u2019x 814, *1 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (unpublished).

Separate from \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause is its elements clause, which defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Mr. Duhart also argued that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery did not qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause because conspiracy does not require an overt act toward the commission of substantive Hobbs Act robbery. According to Mr. Duhart, because Johnson invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause, and because conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery was not otherwise a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause, Count 3 could not stand. The District Court agreed with Mr. Duhart and vacated his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. The government appealed, arguing (1) that the District Court was without jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) Johnson did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause. We held the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion, but reversed in light of our decision in In re Garrett, 908 F.3d 686 (11th Cir. 2018), which held that Johnson did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause.

While our court has held that Davis announced a new rule of constitutional law retroactive to cases on collateral review, see In re Hammoud, 931 F.3d 1032, 1037\u201338 (11th Cir. 2019), we have also recognized two important limitations to Davis\u2019s scope. First, Davis addressed only the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on crimes of violence, while leaving undisturbed \u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on drug trafficking crimes. See In re Navarro, 931 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 924(c) convictions \u201cfully supported by [] drug-trafficking crimes\u201d are \u201coutside the scope of Davis\u201d).

    "content": "for his \u00a7 924(c) count, but his plea agreement identifies only a predicate crime of violence. And during Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea colloquy, the court explained that his \u00a7 924(c) charge was based on a crime of violence, while making no mention of a predicate drug trafficking crime. On these facts, it is plain that Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction was predicated only on a crime of violence. See Brown, 942 F.3d at 1074\u201375. IV. That brings us to whether the offense underlying Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction otherwise qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. As an initial matter, Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea agreement and colloquy make clear that the designated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d underlying his \u00a7 924(c) conviction was conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery rather than substantive Hobbs Act robbery. This distinction is important, because this court\u2019s precedent provides that substantive Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. In re Fleur, 824 F.3d 1337, 1340\u201341 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). In contrast, this Court in Brown held that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. 942 F.3d at 1075\u201376. Based on our precedent, then, the sole predicate offense for Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction\u2014conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery\u2014cannot support his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s",

Exercising appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm both of the district court\u2019s orders and deny her motion to expedite as moot. BACKGROUND Ms. Lynn filed the complaints underlying her appeals in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma. Though her allegations in these related cases are difficult to follow in many respects, together they appear to allege that Ms. Lynn provided services to Mr. Brown\u2019s elderly sister, Audrey Louise Brown (Audrey), from 2008 through 2017. She claims that in September 2017, Audrey executed documents that appointed Ms. Lynn as Audrey\u2019s \u201cguardian, caregiver, trustee, beneficiary, devisee, legatee, and personal representative of the Audrey\n\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.",

Ms. Lynn complains that the probate court also removed her as Audrey\u2019s guardian and appointed a guardian ad litem and other temporary and then permanent guardians for Audrey, as well as a conservator to administer Audrey\u2019s property and assets. It also appears from Ms. Lynn\u2019s allegations that the probate court invalidated the documents that purportedly gave her control over Audrey and her assets and made her the beneficiary of Audrey\u2019s estate. Both complaints also include other rambling and conclusory allegations about actions taken by different individuals and entities with respect to Audrey and/or her estate. Against this backdrop, Ms. Lynn\u2019s first complaint asserts claims for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Mr. Brown, based on allegedly false statements he made about her in legal documents filed in the guardianship proceedings. We refer to this action hereinafter as the \u201cDefamation Complaint.\u201d Ms. Lynn did not assert a basis for federal jurisdiction in this complaint, but specifically alleged in it that both she and Mr. Brown were citizens of Oklahoma.

As the district court noted, Ms. Lynn\u2019s rambling complaint alleges that different defendants mistreated Audrey and/or her estate in different ways. Ms. Lynn tries to cast this alleged mistreatment in RICO terms by alleging that the named and unnamed defendants \u201cwere working as a single entity and enterprise to commit extrinsic fraud, intrinsic fraud, extortion, kidnapping, undue influence, perjury, forgery, mail, and wire fraud through communications.\u201d No. 19-5063 R. at 12. But this apparent attempt to allege an \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d RICO enterprise7 fails not only because it is conclusory, see Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir. 1991) (holding that a pro se litigant\u2019s \u201cconclusory allegations without supporting factual averments are insufficient to state a claim on which relief can be based\u201d), but also because Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaint does not connect the defendants\u2019 different conduct to the alleged enterprise or provide a plausible basis for finding that the defendants were and are functioning as a continuing unit, see Boyle v.

Memorandum Opinion by Justice Stevens\n\nMEMORANDUM OPINION\n\nIrish Shuntay Ware pled guilty to robbery and was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision for ten years under her plea bargain agreement with the State. The terms and conditions of Ware\u2019s community supervision required her to refrain from committing another criminal offense or consuming alcoholic beverages, among other things. The State moved to adjudicate Ware\u2019s guilt on several grounds, including that she committed the offense of driving while intoxicated (DWI) on June 1, 2019. After Ware pled true to this allegation and the trial court heard evidence on each ground in the State\u2019s motion, the trial court adjudicated Ware\u2019s guilt and sentenced her to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.",

New hires such as Mohn participate in Progressive\u2019s customer service academy program. As part of the academy, Progressive assigns each employee a coach who provides job-specific training. When the coach and a program manager conclude that a trainee meets certain job-related metrics, the trainee graduates from the academy. Trainees typically graduate after participating in the academy for 10 to 12 weeks. Mohn graduated in 13 weeks, finishing in March 2017. In the summer of 2017, Mohn sought permission to apply for other positions with Progressive despite the company\u2019s policy that customer service representatives work with the company for a least a year before applying to switch positions. One of Mohn\u2019s supervisors declined his request to apply for a position with Progressive\u2019s information technology service desk because Mohn\u2019s description of his experience did not \u201cmatch what [was] minimally required\u201d for the job.

Mohn then filed this suit, alleging Progressive engaged in sex discrimination by delaying his graduation from the academy, refusing to promote him, and terminating him. Prior to the discovery cutoff, Mohn filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2019. In his motion, he complained that Progressive had not adequately responded to all his discovery requests and asked that the court compel additional discovery. But he nonetheless \u201ccontend[ed] all the necessary factual issues [were] settled or so one-sided they need not be tried, for there [were] no important facts still in dispute.\u201d Id. at 64.1 After conducting additional discovery, Progressive filed a cross-motion for summary judgment in April 2019.

Mohn argues that the district court erred by failing to consider how the circumstances surrounding his termination support an inference that Progressive\u2019s stated rationale was pretextual. These include: (1) Progressive\u2019s shifting rationale; (2) Progressive\u2019s delay in providing its rationale; (3) the company\u2019s deviation from its policy of providing a warning or discipline before termination; (4) a factfinder\u2019s potential disbelief of Progressive\u2019s reason for his termination; (5) Mohn\u2019s practice of often kicking open doors without punishment before he made claims of discrimination; (6) Progressive\u2019s policies that do not support termination for similar acts; and (7) Progressive\u2019s shoddy investigation.

Mohn Does Not Develop Any Other Arguments on Appeal Mohn also purports to appeal from the district court\u2019s rejection of his motions to amend his complaint. We review the \u201cdecision to deny leave to amend a complaint for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Hertz v. Luzenac Grp., 576 F.3d 1103, 1117 (10th Cir. 2009). Mohn fails to articulate how the district court abused its discretion with respect to these matters. We therefore decline to review these rulings. See, e.g., Kelley v. City of Albuquerque, 542 F.3d 802, 819 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[P]erfunctory\u201d allegations of error that \u201cfail[] to frame and develop an issue\u201d are insufficient \u201cto invoke appellate review.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). III. Conclusion For the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Progressive Insurance and its denial of summary judgment to Justin Mohn.

Whether visitors must pay a fee as part of their trip is determined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (REA). This prescriptive statute details when the agencies that run and maintain our public lands can and cannot impose a fee: the REA generally allows fees for developed areas but proscribes fees for undeveloped ones. Thomas Alpern claims that the United States Forest Service (Forest Service) improperly charges him a fee when he enters Maroon Valley to park and hike. He cites a REA provision that he claims prohibits charging a fee \u201c[s]olely for parking[.]\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A). He argues that this prohibition overrides another REA provision that allows agencies to charge a fee when certain listed amenities are present\u2014amenities such as picnic tables, security patrols, trash bins, and interpretive signs. Id. \u00a7 6802(f)(4). We disagree. Section 6802(d)(1)(A) prohibits charging fees \u201c[s]olely for parking . . . along roads or trailsides[,]\u201d something Alpern does not do. He parks in a developed parking lot featuring all the amenities listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4), not along a road or trailside. So we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to reject Alpern\u2019s as-applied challenge to the Maroon Valley fee program. BACKGROUND",

In this case, Alpern concedes that all three developed parking lots in Maroon Valley contain the six amenities listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4), making it a location where the Forest Service can charge a standard amenity fee unless \u00a7 6802(d)(1) applies.

Thus, the sole question before us is whether \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)\u2019s exception applies to Alpern\u2019s use of the developed parking lots in Maroon Valley, making the Forest Service\u2019s fee program unlawful as it applies to him.3 Section 6802(d)(1)(A) prohibits \u201cthe Forest Service\u201d from charging \u201cany standard amenity recreation fee . . . [s]olely for parking, undesignated parking, or picnicking along roads or trailsides.\u201d \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Alpern contends that \u201cparking\u201d is not modified by \u201calong roads or trailsides\u201d such that this provision prohibits fees \u201csolely for parking,\u201d meaning the fee is improper as applied to him because even though he parks in a developed lot (which is one of the six amenities in (f)(4)), he never uses any of the other five amenities. Appellant\u2019s Opening Br. 17\u201318, 26. This interpretation is incorrect.

Enumerating the types of visitors who are exempt from fees when they do not use amenities demonstrates that Congress knows how to exempt visitors who do not use amenities. So by not exempting visitors who park in a (f)(4)-fee area without using amenities, Congress allows such visitors to be charged a fee despite not using all of the amenities. See Navajo Nation v.

    "content": "6 Alpern claims in his declaration that he has \u201cnever seen a Ranger Patrolling West or East Maroon Portal or drive by while I am there,\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. at 27, as though this indicates that security services are not provided and, thus, he does not use them. But this lack of encounters with security is easily explained by other parts of his declaration. For example, he often starts hiking before 6:00 AM. And he claims to not use any amenities, meaning that he goes straight from his car to the trails, leaving little time in the parking lot for a chance encounter with security.\n\n7 Alpern concludes his Reply Brief by \u201cask[ing us] to join the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holdings regarding the REA and find that the Forest Service\u2019s practice of charging fees for users who park solely to access the undeveloped lands beyond the areas with amenities does not comport with the REA.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 21 (referencing Adams v. U.S. Forest Serv., 671 F.3d 1138, 1139\u201340 (9th Cir. 2012)). But Alpern misunderstands the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding. Instead of providing support\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe conclude that the Forest Service properly charges Alpern a fee when he parks in one of three developed Maroon Valley lots. Thus, we affirm the district court and dismiss the case.",
