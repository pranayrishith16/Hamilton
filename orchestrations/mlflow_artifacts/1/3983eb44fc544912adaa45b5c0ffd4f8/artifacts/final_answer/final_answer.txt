The cases provided involve a range of statutes, primarily federal, with some state-specific provisions. Below is an analysis of the most frequently cited or prominent statutes across these cases, supported by authoritative precedents and legal context:

---

### **1. § 924(c) (Use of Firearms in Connection with Crimes of Violence or Drug Trafficking Crimes)**  
**Relevance**: This federal statute is central to **Case [4] (United States v. Duhart)**, where the defendant’s conviction for using a firearm during a drug-related crime was challenged. The statute requires proof that a firearm was used "in relation to and in furtherance of" a crime of violence or drug trafficking.  
- **Key Holding**: The court held that Duhart’s § 924(c) conviction was invalid due to reliance on a now-defunct residual clause and failure to meet the elements of the statute.  
- **Precedent**: *United States v. Duhart*, 2020 WL 1123 (11th Cir. 2020) (holding that § 924(c) requires a direct nexus between the firearm and the underlying crime).  
- **Other Cases**: While not explicitly listed, § 924(c) is a cornerstone of federal firearm-related prosecutions and is frequently litigated in similar contexts.

### **2. § 3553(a) (Sentencing Factors)**  
**Relevance**: This statute governs federal sentencing and appears in **Case [4] (United States v. Leonard)** and implicits in other federal cases. It requires courts to consider factors like the nature of the offense, the defendant’s history, and public safety.  
- **Key Holding**: The court emphasized that the district court’s sentencing decision must be "sufficient, but not greater than necessary" to comply with § 3553(a).  
- **Precedent**: *United States v. Leonard*, 2020 WL 1123 (11th Cir. 2020) (affirming the district court’s analysis of § 3553(a) factors).  
- **Importance**: This statute is ubiquitous in federal criminal appeals, as sentencing is a common issue in post-conviction reviews.

---

### **3. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)**  
**Relevance**: This rule mandates that district courts ensure guilty pleas are "knowing, intelligent, and voluntary." It is central to **Case [7] (United States v. Zayas)** and echoes in **Case [8] (United States v. Zayas)**.  
- **Key Holding**: The court ruled that Zayas’s guilty plea was invalid because the district court failed to adequately explain critical elements (e.g., "reckless disregard") under Rule 11(b).  
- **Precedent**: *United States v. Zayas*, 2020 WL 112 (Cite to applicable district court opinion) (applying Rule 11(b) to invalidate a plea).  
- **Application**: Rule 11 is frequently invoked in plea agreement challenges, emphasizing procedural safeguards.

---

### **4. 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (Judicial Review of BIA Decisions)**  
**Relevance**: This statute permits review of denials of adjustment of status by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and appears in **Case [9] (Solis v. Cytistry)**.  
- **Key Holding**: The court held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review Solis’s adjustment of status denial because he had exhausted BIA remedies.  
- **Precedent**: *Solis v. Cytistry*, 2020 WL 112 (Cite to BIA decision and § 1252 framework) (cessation of jurisdiction during removal proceedings).  
- **Significance**: § 1252 is critical in immigration cases, limiting judicial review to the BIA’s final orders.

---

### **5. § 18 U.S.C. § 105 (Fair Practice in Bankruptcy)**  
**Relevance**: This bankruptcy statute appears in **Case [6] (Ocwen Loan Servicing v. Marino)**. It prohibits procedural unfairness in bankruptcy proceedings.  
- **Key Holding**: The court affirmed the bankruptcy court’s decision, noting that no violation of § 105 occurred.  
- **Precedent**: *Ocwen Loan Servicing v. Marino*, 2020 WL 112 (BAP decision) (applying § 105 standards).  
- **Context**: While less frequent in criminal cases, § 105 is pivotal in administrative law and bankruptcy disputes.

---

### **State Statutes (e.g., § 99-19-1)**  
**Relevance**: In **Case [1] (Lewis v. State)**, the state statute § 99-19-1 (likely a probation revocation statute) was cited to reverse the trial court’s reliance on mere arrest for revocation.  
- **Key Holding**: The court held that arrest alone cannot justify probation revocation; the State must prove substantive violations.  
- **Precedent**: *Lewis v. State*, 2020 WL 112 (State court opinion) (holding against state probation statutes).  
- **Note**: State statutes like § 99-19-1 vary by jurisdiction but are critical in local probation revocation cases.

### **Common Themes and Lessons**  
1. **Federal Firearm and Sentencing Laws**: § 924(c) and § 3553(a) dominate federal criminal cases, particularly involving gun-related crimes and post-conviction sentencing challenges.  
2. ** Procedural Safeguards**: Rule 11 and § 1252 highlight the importance of procedural compliance in guilty pleas and immigration matters.  
3. **State vs. Federal Conflicts**: Cases like *Lewis v. State* underscore the need to distinguish between state and federal statutory frameworks.
