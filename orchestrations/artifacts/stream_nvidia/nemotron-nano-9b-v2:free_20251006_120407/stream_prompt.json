EPI contends that Brooks\u2019s other companies\u2014not Oracle\u2014paid all invoices for the well\u2019s expenses. But Oracle claims that Brooks, through oral contracts with himself acting on behalf of his companies, directed the payments on the understanding that Oracle would be obligated to reimburse the other companies. EPI points out that Louisiana law requires that, in addition to Brooks\u2019s testimony, Oracle must present \u201ccorroborating evidence\u201d that the contract existed; Oracle has provided none.\n\nEPI moved for summary judgment. Concluding that Oracle could not establish that it had sustained damages, the district court granted the motion. We have examined the briefs, the applicable law, and pertinent parts of the record and have heard the oral arguments of counsel. The district court properly granted summary judgment as explained primarily in its comprehensive Order and Reasons entered on June 6, 2019. The judgment is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons set forth in that order.\n\nCase: 19-30519 Document: 00515301742 Page: 2 Date Filed: 02/07/2020\n\n\n[3] data/2020-02-06_wilmington_savings_fund_societ_v._teresa_velardi.pdf (Page None)\nHoldings: ['equal civil rights\u2019\u201d and cannot enforce those rights in state court.', 'Nor did Velardi show that she was denied or cannot enforce her rights in state court.']\nDisposition: Remanded\nStatutes: ['\u00a7 1441', '\u00a7 1443', '\u00a7 1443(1)', '\u00a7 1443(2)', '\u00a7 1447(d)']\nCourt: \nDate: \nParties: \nCase Name: \nProcedural Posture: Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania\n\nExcerpt:\ncases to state court is constrained by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which states that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is generally not reviewable on appeal.

Those bids and invoices, which were prepared approximately seven years prior to the storm that caused the damage claimed by Sunflower in this case, related to various roof repairs at the Sunflower Property.
