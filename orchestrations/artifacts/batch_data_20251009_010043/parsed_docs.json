Richard Mark Gergel, District Judge. (2:15-cr-00234-RMG-1)\nSubmitted: January 28, 2020 Decided: February 7, 2020\nBefore GREGORY, Chief Judge, and WYNN and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit Judges.\nAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nEmily Deck Harrill, Assistant Federal Public Defender, OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL\nPUBLIC DEFENDER, Columbia, South Carolina, for Appellant. Beth Drake, United\nStates Attorney, Columbia, South Carolina, Nathan S. Williams, Assistant United States\nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Charleston, South Carolina,\nfor Appellee.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM:\nJordan Akeem McDaniel pled guilty to interfering with commerce by robbery\n(Hobbs Act robbery), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (2018), and possessing a firearm\nin furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (2018). The\ndistrict court sentenced McDaniel to 204 months\u2019 imprisonment for Hobbs Act robbery\nand 84 months for the \u00a7 924(c) conviction, to be served consecutively to each other but\nconcurrently with a then yet-to-be imposed state sentence for voluntary manslaughter.\nMcDaniel appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge\nand contends that the sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable.\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nFirst, McDaniel argues that Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under\n\u00a7 924(c). Although \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague following United\nStates v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019); United States v. Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 232-\n33, 252 (4th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 304 (2019), \u201cHobbs Act robbery\nconstitutes a crime of violence under the force clause of [\u00a7] 924(c),\u201d United States v.\nMathis, 932 F.3d 242, 266 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, Nos. 19-6423, 19-6424, 2019 WL\n6689801, 2019 WL 6689802 (U.S. Dec. 9, 2019). Therefore, the district court did not err\nin denying McDaniel\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nSecond, McDaniel argues that the district court substantively erred because it\ndeviated from a sentence to which it previously committed itself without providing\n2adequate explanation and because the district court based its sentence on a state offense\nthat was not relevant conduct.1 We disagree.\nWe review a sentence \u201cfor reasonableness \u2018under a deferential abuse-of-discretion\nstandard,\u2019\u201d whether the sentence \u201cis \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the\nGuidelines range.\u2019\u201d United States v. McCoy, 804 F.3d 349, 351 (4th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nGall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007)). This review entails appellate consideration\nof the procedural reasonableness of the sentence. Gall, 552 U.S. at 49-51. In assessing\nprocedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court provided a sufficient\nexplanation for the chosen sentence, including an explanation for any deviation from the\nGuidelines. Id. at 51; see United States v. Lynn, 592 F.3d 572, 575 (4th Cir. 2010). When\nimposing a sentence, the district court \u201cmust place on the record an \u2018individualized\nassessment\u2019 based on the particular facts of the case before it\u201d that \u201cprovide[s] a rationale\ntailored to the particular case at hand and [is] adequate to permit \u2018meaningful appellate\nreview.\u2019\u201d United States v. Carter, 564 F.3d 325, 330 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Gall, 552\nU.S. at 50).\nIn reviewing the substantive reasonableness of an above-Guidelines sentence, when\na district court departs from or imposes a sentence outside of the Guidelines range, we\n\u201cmust consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently\n1 Although McDaniel raises only a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of\nhis sentence, his argument that the district court failed to adequately explain its sentence is\nbest construed as a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence.\n3compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d United States v. Zuk, 874 F.3d 398, 409\n(4th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[E]ven though [this court] might\nreasonably conclude that a different sentence is appropriate, that conclusion, standing\nalone, is an insufficient basis to vacate the district court\u2019s chosen sentence.\u201d Id. (internal\nquotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted).\nTo the extent McDaniel argues his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because\nthe district court failed to explain the reason it was departing from its previous statement\nof the sentence it was inclined to impose, we find this argument lacks merit. The district\ncourt stated at a status of counsel conference that it had \u201c[not] made a decision yet\u201d but\nnoted that it was \u201cnot inclined to [sentence McDaniel] above 20 years.\u201d Contrary to\nMcDaniel\u2019s assertions, nothing in the district court\u2019s statements prior to the sentencing\nhearing committed it to imposing a particular sentence.\nThe district court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, noting\nthat McDaniel dragged an elderly victim into a business at night, threw the victim to the\nfloor, and threatened the victim with a gun, which the district court explained was a \u201cvery\nviolent dangerous episode,\u201d \u201cshow[ing] a level of malice and viciousness that is not a\ntypical robbery.\u201d The district court also considered McDaniel\u2019s history and characteristics,\nexplaining that it was concerned about his \u201cpattern of dangerous escalating violence since\ndischarge from prison, not adequately accommodated in the guidelines.\u201d Finally, the\ndistrict court considered promotion of respect for the law, just punishment, deterrence, and\nthe protection of the public. We conclude that the district court provided an adequately\ndetailed and individualized explanation for the chosen sentence it imposed.\n4We also conclude that the district court did not substantively err in selecting the\nsentence. First, as previously stated, the record is inconsistent with McDaniel\u2019s argument\nthat the district court committed itself to a sentence of not greater than 20 years. Second,\na district court is permitted at sentencing to consider, \u201cwithout limitation, any information\nconcerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise\nprohibited by law.\u201d USSG \u00a7 1B1.4; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661 (2018). That McDaniel pled guilty\nin state court to a voluntary manslaughter committed so close in time to a violent robbery\nis plainly relevant to a number of the statutory sentencing factors, including McDaniel\u2019s\nhistory and characteristics, deterrence, promotion of respect for the law, and protection of\nthe public. Under the totality of the circumstances\u2014the viciousness of the offense conduct\nand McDaniel\u2019s pattern of escalating violence\u2014McDaniel\u2019s sentence is substantively\nreasonable.\nAccordingly, we remove this appeal from abeyance2 and affirm the criminal\njudgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\nadequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the\ndecisional process.\nAFFIRMED\n2 We previously placed this appeal in abeyance for No. 15-4433, United States v.\nAli. In light of our decision in Mathis\u2014which disposes of McDaniel\u2019s argument that\nHobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence under the force clause of\n\u00a7 924(c)\u2014we remove this appeal from abeyance.\n5",

Wolpert\nClerk of Court\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff - Appellee,\nv. No. 18-6192\n(D.C. No. 5:18-CR-00114-R-1)\nFREDDY HERRERA-RIVAS, a/k/a Fredy (W.D. Okla.)\nHerrera, a/k/a Rubio Herrera,\nDefendant - Appellant.\n_________________________________\nORDER AND JUDGMENT*\n_________________________________\nBefore LUCERO, BALDOCK, and MORITZ, Circuit Judges.\n_________________________________\nFreddy Herrera-Rivas pleaded guilty to unlawfully reentering the United States\nafter removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Herrera-Rivas later moved to withdraw his\nguilty plea under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, contending his original removal order was\ninvalid. The district court denied the motion to withdraw. Exercising jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.\n* After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nsubmitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent,\nexcept under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It\nmay be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1\nand 10th Cir. R. 32.1.BACKGROUND\nHerrera-Rivas is a native and citizen of Mexico. On October 27, 2008, the\nUnited States Department of Homeland Security served Herrera-Rivas with a Notice\nto Appear (NTA), alleging he was subject to removal and ordering him to appear\nbefore an immigration judge (IJ) at a date and time \u201cto be set.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 20.\nHerrera-Rivas signed the NTA, requesting an immediate hearing and waiving his\nright to a 10-day period before his appearance. Herrera-Rivas also signed a\n\u201cStipulated Request for Order [and] Waiver of Hearing,\u201d in which he confirmed that:\n(1) he had been served with the NTA; (2) he waived his right to a hearing and\nrequested his proceedings be conducted on the record; (3) he admitted the facts as\nalleged in the NTA; (4) he conceded he was subject to removal; and (5) he did not\nwish to seek relief from removal. Id. at 43-46. On November 12, 2008, an IJ ordered\nhis removal, and Herrera-Rivas was removed two days later.\nHerrera-Rivas returned to the United States in 2010 and was removed in 2012,\nwithout objection, based on the 2008 removal order. He returned to the United States\nagain in 2013 and was indicted in 2018 of illegally reentering after removal in\nviolation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Herrera-Rivas initially pleaded guilty but, six weeks\nlater, moved to withdraw his plea on the ground \u201cthat an absolute defense to the\nIndictment had been overlooked.\u201d Id. at 9. In a proposed motion to dismiss attached\nto the motion to withdraw, Herrera-Rivas sought to collaterally attack the validity of\nhis 2008 removal order under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d). Specifically, in his proposed\nmotion to dismiss, Herrera-Rivas contended his 2008 removal order was void\n2because his 2008 NTA failed to specify a date and time for his appearance and,\ntherefore, was defective under Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018). The\ndistrict court denied the motion to withdraw, concluding that the proposed motion to\ndismiss lacked merit and that allowing Herrera-Rivas to withdraw his plea and file\nthe proposed motion to dismiss would waste judicial resources. The court later\nentered its judgment and sentenced Herrera-Rivas to time served.\nDISCUSSION\nHerrera-Rivas\u2019s sole contention on appeal is that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We disagree.\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review the \u201cdenial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea . . . for abuse of\ndiscretion\u201d and \u201cwill not reverse a district court\u2019s decision unless the defendant can\nshow that the court acted unjustly or unfairly.\u201d United States v. Sanchez-Leon,\n764 F.3d 1248, 1259 (10th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe\nreview factual findings for clear error\u201d and \u201clegal conclusions de novo, such as\nwhether the plea was made knowingly and voluntarily or whether counsel was\nineffective.\u201d Id.\nB. Analysis\nWhen a guilty plea has been accepted by the district court, \u201c[a] defendant may\nwithdraw a guilty plea before sentencing if he \u2018can show a fair and just reason for\nrequesting the withdrawal.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1258 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B)). In\ndeciding a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, a district court should consider:\n3\u201c(1) whether the defendant has asserted his innocence, (2) prejudice to the\ngovernment, (3) delay in filing [the] motion, (4) inconvenience to the court,\n(5) defendant\u2019s assistance of counsel, (6) whether the plea is knowing and voluntary,\nand (7) waste of judicial resources.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, the district court determined Herrera-Rivas could not \u201cestablish a fair\nand just reason for the withdrawal.\u201d R., Vol. 1 at 104. In particular, the court found:\n(1) he waived any challenge to the 2008 NTA and the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction to order his\nremoval by stipulating to the allegations and seeking removal; and (2) Pereira\naddressed a \u201cnarrow issue\u201d and did not support invalidating the original removal\norder. Id. at 103-04. Because the court found no merit to the proposed motion to\ndismiss and because Herrera-Rivas did \u201cnot allege his innocence []or protest that his\nplea was not knowing and voluntary,\u201d the court found \u201cpermitting him to withdraw\nhis plea to file the motion would merely result in a wasting of judicial resources.\u201d Id.\nat 104. And because \u201c[t]he remaining factors [did] not weigh heavily for or against\npermitting [him] to withdraw his plea,\u201d the court concluded he had failed to carry his\nburden of demonstrating a fair and just reason for withdrawing his plea. Id.1\n1 The sole argument Herrera-Rivas advanced in his motion to dismiss was that\nthe 2008 removal order was invalid based upon Pereira. Because the district court\nrejected the Pereira argument, and therefore determined a collateral attack on the\n2008 removal order would be futile, the court declined to address the statutory factors\nfor a collateral attack. See generally 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d) (prohibiting a collateral\nattack on a removal order unless the alien shows \u201c(1) the alien exhausted any\nadministrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order;\n(2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived\nthe alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was\nfundamentally unfair\u201d). Herrera-Rivas has not contended the court erred in failing to\n4Herrera-Rivas contends the district court erred in determining there was not a\nfair and just reason for allowing him to withdraw his plea because: (1) his original\nNTA was invalid under Pereira because it failed to specify a date and time for the\nhearing; (2) the IJ, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to order his removal in 2008; and\n(3) \u201c[b]ecause there was no valid removal order, [he] is not guilty as a matter of law\nof unlawful reentry as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a).\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 14. As\nour recent decisions confirm, the district court correctly determined that Pereira was\ninapposite and that Herrera-Rivas\u2019s jurisdictional argument lacked merit.2\nThe Supreme Court held in Pereira that \u201c[a] putative notice to appear that fails\nto designate the specific time or place of a non-citizen\u2019s removal proceedings is not a\n\u2018notice to appear under section 1229(a), and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\u2019\u201d\n138 S. Ct. at 2113-14. But as we recently explained in Lopez-Munoz v. Barr,\n941 F.3d 1013 (10th Cir. 2019), Pereira addressed only the narrow question of\n\u201cwhether a defective notice to appear had interrupted a noncitizen\u2019s continuous\npresence in the United States\u201d for purposes of the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) and \u201cdid not address the distinct question of whether a defect in the\nnotice to appear would preclude jurisdiction over the removal proceedings.\u201d\nLopez-Munoz, 941 F.3d at 1018 (internal quotation marks omitted). We noted \u201cother\nevaluate these factors, and therefore, has waived appellate review of this issue.\nSee Rodas-Orellana v. Holder, 780 F.3d 982, 998 (10th Cir. 2015).\n2 We therefore need not address the court\u2019s conclusion that Herrera-Rivas also\nwaived his Pereira-based jurisdictional challenge to his original removal order.\n5circuits have declined to treat Pereira as a limitation on an immigration judge\u2019s\njurisdiction,\u201d and we joined them \u201cin declining to read Pereira as an implicit\npronouncement on an immigration judge\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 1018. We since have\n\u201cfollow[ed] the lead of Lopez-Munoz and join[ed] the overwhelming chorus of our\nsister circuits that have . . . rejected similar Pereira-based challenges.\u201d\nMartinez-Perez v. Barr, __ F.3d __, No. 18-9573, 2020 WL 253553, at *3 (10th Cir.\nJan. 17, 2020) (internal quotation marks omitted) (collecting cases). Moreover, we\nhave clarified that \u201cthe requirements relating to notices to appear are\nnon-jurisdictional, claim-processing rules.\u201d Id.\nBased on our decisions in Lopez-Munoz and Martinez-Perez, Herrera-Rivas\u2019s\n\u201c[r]eliance on Pereira is misplaced.\u201d Lopez-Munoz, 941 F.3d at 1017. \u201cWhile\n[his] notice to appear was defective\u201d because it failed to specify a date and time to\nappear, \u201cthat did not divest the Immigration Court of jurisdiction.\u201d Martinez-Perez,\n__ F.3d at __, 2020 WL 253553, at *3. Because Herrera-Rivas\u2019s proposed motion to\ndismiss lacked merit, the district court properly found that permitting him to\nwithdraw his plea and file the proposed motion to dismiss would waste judicial\nresources. Herrera-Rivas has not contested the court\u2019s assessment of the other\nfactors for permitting the withdrawal of a guilty plea. Accordingly, Herrera-Rivas\nhas failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to\nwithdraw his guilty plea.\n6CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.\nEntered for the Court\nNancy L.

David W. Hercher, Bankruptcy Judge for the District of Oregon, sitting by\ndesignation.\n2jurisdiction over the order denying his motion to dismiss or alternatively\nfor summary judgment and sua sponte staying the adversary proceeding.\nTherefore, we DISMISS the appeal from this order for lack of jurisdiction.\nI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nA. Prepetition events\nDr. Ross is a licensed physician in Nevada. Rodriguez is a physician's\nassistant, licensed to practice medicine under the supervision of a licensed\nphysician in Nevada.\nIn August 2013, Rodriguez formed Rutishauser, LLC, dba NLV Pain\nManagement (\"LLC\" or \"NLV Pain\"), a medical practice that offered pain\nmanagement, urgent care, urine analysis testing, and a pharmaceutical\ndispensary for patients involved in personal injury claims. Soon thereafter,\nRodriguez and Dr. Ross agreed that Dr. Ross would serve as Medical\nDirector for NLV Pain. Dr. Ross received a salary and a 15% ownership\ninterest in the LLC.\nIn October 2014, Rodriguez and Dr. Ross agreed to increase Dr. Ross's\nownership interest in the LLC to 33% in exchange for an additional $60,000\ninvestment.1 Dr. Ross also made two loans to the LLC. In January 2015, he\nmade a $100,000 loan for the purpose of growing the business of NLV Pain,\nand in mid-October 2015, he made an emergency loan of $25,000 to cover\npayroll. In November 2015, Dr. Ross's two loans were consolidated in an\n1 The following facts are as alleged by Dr. Ross.\n3unsecured promissory note signed by Rodriguez in favor of Dr. Ross.\nDuring this same time period, Dr. Ross repeatedly requested\nfinancial information about the LLC. Other than receiving a one-page\nspreadsheet in February 2015, Dr. Ross was denied access to the LLC's\nfinancial records until April 2015, when Rodriguez finally provided him\nwith online \"view only\" access to the LLC's operating account. Upon\nreview, Dr. Ross noticed unusually large financial transactions and\nirregularities.\nUltimately, Rodriguez produced the LLC's financial records for 2014\nand 2015. The financials showed that Rodriguez was embezzling funds,\nusing LLC money to pay for items not typically paid for with cash (i.e.,\nrent), and making unexplained cash withdrawals. The financials also\nshowed highly suspicious billing practices and commingling of funds with\nother entities not owned by Dr. Ross.\nThereafter, Dr. Ross demanded that all improper billing cease, that\nRodriguez repay all embezzled funds and unauthorized expenditures or\ndistributions, that Rodriguez provide an explanation for money transfers\nfrom the LLC, and that all patient billing be suspended pending an\ninvestigation. Rodriguez refused Dr. Ross's demands and notified Dr. Ross\nof his immediate removal as Medical Director for NLV Pain.\nIn December 2015, Dr. Ross filed suit against Rodriguez (and others)\nin state court for (1) breach of contract, (2) tortious breach of the implied\n4covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (3) fraudulent misrepresentation,\n(4) breach of fiduciary duty, (5) civil conspiracy, (6) embezzlement/theft/\nconversion, (7) unjust enrichment, (8) injunctive relief, (9) an accounting,\nand (10) constructive trust (\"State Court Action\"). The State Court Action\nwas pending for 2 1/2 years when Rodriguez filed his petition.\nB. Postpetition events\nRodriguez filed his chapter 72 bankruptcy case on August 6, 2018. On\nthat same day, he removed the State Court Action to the bankruptcy court,\nwhich the bankruptcy court remanded on Dr. Ross's motion. The remand\norder was not appealed. Dr. Ross filed a timely adversary complaint\nagainst Rodriguez for claims under \u00a7 523(a)(2) and (4). Rodriguez received\na chapter 7 discharge on November 14, 2018.\n1. Dr. Ross's motion for relief from stay (Appeal No. 19-1081)\nOn December 4, 2018, Dr. Ross moved for relief from the automatic\nstay under \u00a7 362(d)(1) to continue with the State Court Action against\nRodriguez (\"Stay Relief Motion\"). Rodriguez argued that \"cause\" did not\nexist to terminate the stay, because Dr. Ross's claims in the State Court\nAction: (1) were discharged in the bankruptcy; (2) were property of the\n2 Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are to the\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-1532, all \"Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of\nBankruptcy Procedure, and all \"Civil Rule\" references are to the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure.\n5LLC's bankruptcy estate;3 or (3) would be resolved by Dr. Ross's adversary\ncomplaint. Dr. Ross agreed that the only claims against Rodriguez not\ndischarged were those for fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of\nfiduciary duty and embezzlement.\nAfter a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an order granting the\nStay Relief Motion (\"Stay Relief Order\"), finding that Dr. Ross had\nestablished \"cause.\" Rodriguez moved for reconsideration of the Stay Relief\nOrder, which the bankruptcy court denied. Rodriguez timely appealed the\nStay Relief Order and the order denying reconsideration.\n2. Dr. Ross's adversary complaint (Appeal No. 19-1082)\nRodriguez moved to dismiss Dr. Ross's adversary complaint under\nCivil Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, for summary\njudgment under Civil Rule 56 (\"Motion to Dismiss\"). Dr. Ross opposed the\nMotion to Dismiss.\nAfter a hearing, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying the\nMotion to Dismiss and staying the adversary proceeding until completion\nof the State Court Action (\"Adversary Order\"). Rodriguez timely appealed.\nII. JURISDICTION\nThe bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334 and\n157(b)(2)(G) and (I). We have appellate jurisdiction over the Stay Relief\n3 Rodriguez caused the LLC to file a chapter 7 bankruptcy case on December 18,\n2018.\n6Order under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. However, as we explain below, Rodriguez has\nnot carried his burden of showing that we have appellate jurisdiction over\nthe Adversary Order.\nIII. ISSUES\n1. Did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in granting Dr. Ross\nrelief from the automatic stay to continue with the State Court Action?\n2. Did the bankruptcy court abuse its discretion in denying the motion\nto reconsider the Stay Relief Order?\n3. Do we have jurisdiction over the Adversary Order?\nIV. STANDARDS OF REVIEW\nWe review a bankruptcy court's order granting relief from the\nautomatic stay for an abuse of discretion. Lakhany v. Khan (In re Lakhany),\n538 B.R. 555, 559 (9th Cir. BAP 2015). Denial of a motion to amend or alter\njudgment under Civil Rule 59(e) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\nDixon v. Wallowa Cty., 336 F.3d 1013, 1022 (9th Cir. 2003). A bankruptcy\ncourt abuses its discretion if it applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies\nthe correct one, or makes illogical or implausible factual findings, or\nfindings without support from the facts in the record. See TrafficSchool.com,\nInc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 832 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing U.S. v. Hinkson,\n585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)).\nTo the extent the Panel must determine whether we have jurisdiction\nto grant the relief requested, jurisdiction is reviewed de novo. Lake v. Capps\n7(In re Lake), 202 B.R. 751, 755 (9th Cir. BAP 1996).\nV. DISCUSSION\nA. The bankruptcy court abused its discretion in granting the Stay\nRelief Motion.\nThe bankruptcy court acknowledged that Rodriguez had received a\ndischarge three weeks prior to Dr. Ross filing his Stay Relief Motion, and\nthat the discharge order discharged Rodriguez's personal liability for his\nprepetition debts, except for those to be determined in the adversary\nproceeding. Nonetheless, the court entered the Stay Relief Order granting\nDr. Ross relief from the automatic stay to continue with the State Court\nAction. This was erroneous.\nSection 362 provides, in relevant part, that the filing of a bankruptcy\npetition stays\nthe commencement or continuation, including the issuance or\nemployment of process, of a judicial, administrative, or other\naction or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have\nbeen commenced before the commencement of the case under this\ntitle, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the\ncommencement of the case under this title.\n\u00a7 362(a)(1). But \"'insofar as the automatic stay bars actions against the\ndebtor, the stay automatically expires upon the grant of a discharge.'\" In re\nLakhany, 538 B.R. at 561 (quoting Ruvacalba v. Munoz (In re Munoz), 287 B.R.\n546, 551 (9th Cir. BAP 2002) (referencing \u00a7 362(c)(2)(C)); see also ZiLOG, Inc.\nv. Corning (In re ZiLOG, Inc.), 450 F.3d 996, 1009 n.13 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"We\n8don't understand why the district court discussed the automatic stay. By\nAugust 21, 2002, the automatic stay had long since disappeared; it was only\nthe discharge injunction that was relevant.\"). The court abuses its discretion\nif it grants relief from the automatic stay after it is terminated. In re Lakhany,\n538 B.R. at 561; In re Munoz, 287 B.R. at 551.\nThe automatic stay terminated on November 14, 2018, when the\nbankruptcy court issued Rodriguez's discharge. The court could not\nthereafter grant Dr. Ross relief from the nonexistent stay, and it abused its\ndiscretion when it did so.4 Accordingly, we must REVERSE the Stay Relief\nOrder.5\n4 Proceeding to determine Rodriguez's liability in the State Court Action also\nwould not violate the discharge injunction. The discharge injunction does not apply to\nthis debt, because the debt is the subject of Dr. Ross's adversary proceeding seeking a\ndetermination of its dischargeability. The bankruptcy court may ultimately hold that\nthe debt is discharged, but until that happens, the discharge injunction does not apply.\nSee Kvassay v. Kvassay (In re Kvassay), BAP No. CC-15-1420-KiTaKu, 2016 WL 5845672, at\n*7 (9th Cir. BAP Oct. 6, 2016) (\"[U]pon the timely filing of a complaint objecting to\ndischargeability of a debt under \u00a7 523, the discharge injunction does not apply with\nrespect to that debt until the bankruptcy court makes a determination as to the\ndischargeability of that debt.\") (citing cases).\nThis does not mean, however, that Dr. Ross can proceed to collection should he\nprevail in the State Court Action. The bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction to\ndetermine dischargeability of debts under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) and (6) and that determination\nmust still be made. \u00a7 523(c); Aldrich v. Imbrogno (In re Aldrich), 34 B. R. 776, 781 (9th Cir.\nBAP 1983) (explaining that claims for nondischargeable debts under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) and\n(6) may not be pursued in the state court as a result of the exclusive jurisdiction granted\nto bankruptcy courts by the Code).\n5 For this same reason, we also REVERSE the order denying reconsideration of\n(continued...)\n9B. We lack jurisdiction over the Adversary Order.\nThe appellant has the burden of establishing that the appellate court\nhas jurisdiction to hear the case. Melendres v. Maricopa Cty., 815 F.3d 645,\n649 (9th Cir. 2016). As a threshold matter, we must determine our\njurisdiction over the Adversary Order. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l\nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 430-31 (2007) (generally a federal court must\nfirst determine whether it has jurisdiction before reaching the merits of a\ncase). After Rodriguez filed his notice of appeal, the Clerk issued an order\ndirecting him to file a written response explaining how the Adversary\nOrder was final and immediately reviewable or, alternatively, to file a\nmotion for leave to appeal. Rodriguez filed his response. The motions\npanel deferred ruling on appellate jurisdiction to the merits panel and\nresumed briefing.\nAn order denying a motion to dismiss a \u00a7 523 complaint is an\ninterlocutory order. Travers v. Dragul (In re Travers), 202 B.R. 624, 626 (9th\nCir. BAP 1996). The same is true for an order denying a motion for\nsummary judgment. Jones-Hamilton Co. v. Beazer Materials and Servs., Inc.,\n973 F.2d 688, 690 (9th Cir. 1992). Normally, such orders are not appealable\nas of right.\nWhile Rodriguez concedes that the bankruptcy court's decisions to\n5(...continued)\nthe Stay Relief Order.\n10deny dismissal of the \u00a7 523 complaint and to deny summary judgment are\nnot final and appealable, he argues that the interlocutory order is\nappealable as of right, because the court's sua sponte stay of the adversary\nproceeding is an \"injunctive order\" reviewable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\nWe disagree.\nInterlocutory orders of district courts granting injunctions may be\nappealed to the court of appeals as of right. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).6 That\nstatute is inapplicable here. Unlike the Court of Appeals, the BAP does not\nhave jurisdiction to hear such orders of the bankruptcy court as of right. See\nMorgan-Busby v. Gladstone (In re Morgan-Busby), 272 B.R. 257, 260 n.5 (9th\nCir. BAP 2002); Quigley Co., Inc. v. A.C. Coleman (In re Quigley Co., Inc.), 323\n6 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) provides:\n(a) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, the courts\nof appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from:\n(1) Interlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States,\nthe United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone,\nthe District Court of Guam, and the District Court of the Virgin\nIslands, or of the judges thereof, granting, continuing, modifying,\nrefusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify\ninjunctions, except where a direct review may be had in the\nSupreme Court.\nRodriguez's reliance on Young Properties is misplaced. See Young Props. Corp.\nv. United Equity Corp., 534 F.2d 847, 850 n.1 (9th Cir. 1976) (\"Appellate jurisdiction\nby virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 exists in bankruptcy matters . . . for the granting or\ndenying of injunctions, under \u00a7 1292(a)(1)[.]\"). Young Properties was a Bankruptcy\nAct case and was an appeal from a district court exercising bankruptcy jurisdiction,\nnot from a bankruptcy court.\n11B.R. 70, 75 n.4 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (language in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1) indicates\nthat preliminary injunctive orders should be treated differently from other\ninterlocutory orders for purposes of analyzing appealability, but 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 158(a) dictates which orders of the bankruptcy court are appealable as of\nright and includes only final orders, interlocutory orders issued under\n\u00a7 1121(d), and \"other interlocutory orders and decrees,\" including\npreliminary injunctions, which are only appealable \"with leave of the\ncourt\"); Mirzai v. Kolbe Foods, Inc. (In re Mirzai), 271 B.R. 647, 651 n.4 (C.D.\nCal. 2001), aff'd, 36 F. App'x 619 (9th Cir. 2002) (noting that while orders of\ndistrict courts granting or denying injunctions may be appealed to the\ncourt of appeals as of right under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), there is no similar\nprovision for bankruptcy court orders regarding injunctions). Thus,\nRodriguez has not met his burden of establishing our jurisdiction to hear\nthe appeal as of right.\nThe only way Rodriguez may obtain review of the Adversary Order\nis to seek leave to appeal. The Panel is authorized to grant leave to appeal\ninterlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). In re Travers, 202 B.R. at\n626. Rodriguez did not file a motion for leave to appeal. Instead, he\nrequested in cursory fashion in his response that we grant leave to appeal\nsolely on the basis that it was inequitable for the bankruptcy court to sua\nsponte stay the adversary proceeding pending resolution of the State Court\nAction. Given the lack of a proper motion and supported argument\n12establishing the factors necessary for granting leave, Rodriguez has not met\nhis burden to establish that we should grant leave under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 158(a)(3).\nSince Rodriguez did not meet his burden of establishing our\njurisdiction over the Adversary Order, we DISMISS the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nFor the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the Stay Relief Order, and\nwe DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction the appeal of the Adversary Order.\n13",

Lehrman, Clerk\nv. )\n) THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED\nSTATE OF IDAHO, ) OPINION AND SHALL NOT\n) BE CITED AS AUTHORITY\nRespondent. )\n)\nAppeal from the District Court of the Seventh Judicial District, State of Idaho,\nBonneville County. Hon. Joel E. Tingey, District Judge.\nJudgment summarily dismissing petition for post-conviction relief and denying\nmotion for counsel, affirmed.\nEric D. Fredericksen, State Appellate Public Defender; Sally J. Cooley, Deputy\nAppellate Public Defender, Boise, for appellant.\nHon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Theodore S. Tollefson, Deputy\nAttorney General, Boise, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nBRAILSFORD, Judge\nVestal Dean Caudill appeals the denial of his motion for appointment of counsel to\nrepresent Caudill in his post-conviction case. Specifically, Caudill asserts the district court\nabused its discretion by applying an incorrect legal standard when denying his motion. We\naffirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nIn the underlying case,1 an Idaho State Police Trooper stopped Caudill, who was driving\na blue semi-truck with an empty flatbed near Arco, Idaho. The Trooper advised Caudill that he\n1 Although the district court did not take judicial notice of records from the underlying\ncase, this Court granted Caudill\u2019s motion to take judicial notice of the clerk\u2019s record and the\n1was stopped for the improper use of a turn signal, namely Caudill\u2019s turn signal was activated\nwithout apparent reason. Before running a records check, the Trooper asked to check the truck\nfor other occupants; Caudill consented; and no other occupants were located.\nA records check of Caudill\u2019s license revealed his commercial driver\u2019s license had been\n\u201cdowngraded\u201d for noncompliance. As a result, the Trooper requested Caudill to contact the\nowner of the truck to retrieve it. While waiting, the Trooper asked whether there were drugs in\nthe truck and whether Caudill would consent to the Trooper\u2019s search of the truck. Caudill\ndeclined to consent. Thereafter, the Trooper deployed a drug dog around the truck, and the dog\nalerted on the odor of a controlled substance at the truck\u2019s open passenger door. During a\nsubsequent search of the truck, the Trooper discovered a digital scale and a baggie containing\nmethamphetamine.\nThe State charged Caudill with possession of methamphetamine in violation of Idaho\nCode \u00a7 37-2732(c)(1). Caudill pled guilty; the parties agreed to jointly recommend a sentence;\nand the district court imposed that recommended sentence. Thereafter, Caudill filed a motion for\na reduction in his sentence under Idaho Criminal Rule 35. The district court denied the motion,\nand this Court affirmed the denial on appeal. State v. Caudill, Docket No. 45445 (Ct. App.\nMay 4, 2018) (unpublished).\nWhile his direct appeal was still pending, Caudill filed a pro se petition for post-\nconviction relief and also a motion for appointment of counsel. Before the State had an\nopportunity to respond to Caudill\u2019s petition, the district court denied his motion for appointment\nof counsel and entered a notice of intent to dismiss Caudill\u2019s petition. After Caudill failed to\nrespond to the notice, the district court summarily dismissed his petition. Caudill timely appeals.\nII.\nANALYSIS\nCaudill\u2019s only challenge on appeal is that the district court erred by applying an incorrect\nlegal standard to deny his motion for appointment of counsel. \u201cA decision to grant or to deny a\nrequest for counsel in post-conviction cases is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Shackelford\nv. State, 160 Idaho 317, 325, 372 P.3d 372, 380 (2016). The Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure\ntranscripts filed in his direct appeal of the denial of his Idaho Criminal Rule 35 motion. See\nState v. Caudill, Docket No. 45445 (Ct. App. May 4, 2018) (unpublished) (appealing sentence).\nThe facts set forth herein are derived from materials in that underlying record.\n2Act provides that if a post-conviction petitioner is unable to pay for the expense of\nrepresentation, then the trial court may appoint counsel to represent the petitioner. I.C. \u00a7 19-\n4904. The proper standard for determining whether to appoint counsel for an indigent petitioner\nis whether the petition alleges facts showing the possibility of a valid claim requiring further\ninvestigation. Shackelford, 160 Idaho at 325, 372 P.3d at 380.\nWe agree with Caudill that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard when\ndenying his request for appointment of counsel. The court denied Caudill\u2019s request because he\nfailed to allege \u201ca valid claim for relief\u201d versus \u201cthe possibility of a valid claim.\u201d Specifically,\nthe district court ruled:\n[A]ppointment of counsel is only appropriate where the petitioner alleges facts to\nsupport a valid claim for relief. . . . [I]n the Court\u2019s opinion Caudill\u2019s claims do\nnot state a valid claim for relief. Therefore, the Court denies his request for\nappointment of counsel at this time.\nThe district court\u2019s error, however, does not require remand unless Caudill\u2019s allegations actually\nraise the possibility of a valid claim. As the Idaho Supreme Court has ruled, \u201cWhen addressing\nthe issue of appointment of counsel in post-conviction proceedings, this Court examines whether\nthe possibility of a claim exists before determining that an error in failing to appoint counsel\nrequires remand.\u201d Melton v. State, 148 Idaho 339, 342, 223 P.3d 281, 285 (2009).\nIn determining whether a petitioner raised the possibility of a valid claim, this Court\nconsiders \u201cwhether the appointment of counsel would have assisted [the petitioner] in conducting\nan investigation into facts not in the record and whether a reasonable person with adequate\nmeans would have been willing to retain counsel to conduct that further investigation into the\nclaim.\u201d Id. \u201cIn determining whether the appointment of counsel would be appropriate, every\ninference must run in the petitioner\u2019s favor where the petitioner is unrepresented at the time and\ncannot be expected to know how to properly allege the necessary facts.\u201d Id. A petitioner,\nhowever, is \u201cnot entitled to have counsel appointed in order to search the record for possible\nnonfrivolous claims.\u201d Swader v. State, 143 Idaho 651, 654, 152 P.3d 12, 15 (2007).\nOn appeal, Caudill contends his pro se petition alleges a possible claim for ineffective\nassistance of counsel. That petition takes the form of Caudill\u2019s handwritten comments on a form\npetition for post-conviction relief. In response to the question asking Caudill to \u201cstate concisely\nand in detail what counsel failed to do in representing [his] interests,\u201d Caudill responded:\n(a) not a routene [sic] stop\n(b) not loaded with hay\n3(c) permition [sic] to search truck was denied\nAdditionally, Caudill indicated the grounds supporting his petition included that the Trooper\nexplained he stopped Caudill \u201cfor [his] blinker\u201d but also based on an Amber Alert; conflicting\nreports of the description of the truck subject to the Amber Alert and of the reason for stopping\nCaudill were given; Caudill\u2019s truck was blue and black and not hauling hay; Caudill consented to\nthe Trooper\u2019s request to look in his truck for additional occupants but not to search his truck; if\nthe Trooper was following a truck from Twin Falls, he would have pulled it over before Arco;\nand finally, \u201c[the] Trooper stated the pasenger [sic] door was opened to get registration [] and\nleft open. Why would passenger door be opened [when] registration was on driver\u2019s side[?]\u201d\nLiberally construing these facts, the district court characterized Caudill\u2019s claim as\nasserting \u201cthe officers had no grounds to conduct a traffic stop\u201d and his counsel was \u201cineffective\nin not challenging the evidence obtained from the traffic stop.\u201d On appeal, Caudill argues only\nthat \u201cno evidence in the record . . . controverts [his] claim that his counsel\u2019s performance was\ndeficient for failing to file a motion to suppress\u201d and that the alleged facts raise at least the\npossibility of a valid claim. We disagree.\nAssuming all the facts Caudill alleged as true, his petition does not support a viable\nmotion to suppress. In particular, Caudill\u2019s allegations do not dispute that the Trooper stopped\nCaudill because his turn signal was flashing for no purpose. This conduct gave the Trooper\nreasonable suspicion that Caudill was driving inattentively. See Deen v. State, 131 Idaho 435,\n436, 958 P.2d 592, 593 (1998) (continuously flashing turn signal constitutes reasonable\nsuspicion of inattentive driving). Because Caudill does not dispute this basis for the Trooper\u2019s\nreasonable suspicion,2 that Caudill disputes the Trooper\u2019s alternative reason for stopping him--\nnamely, the Trooper believed Caudill\u2019s truck matched the description of the truck subject to the\nAmber Alert--is inapposite and does not obviate the Trooper\u2019s reasonable suspicion of Caudill\u2019s\ninattentive driving.\nSimilarly, Caudill fails to dispute that, although he did not consent to the Trooper\u2019s\nsearch of his truck, the Trooper did not conduct a search until after the drug dog alerted on the\ntruck. That alert provided probable cause for the Trooper\u2019s search, despite Caudill\u2019s earlier\nrefusal to consent to the search. \u201cWhen a reliable drug-detection dog indicates that a lawfully\n2 The record indicates Caudill conceded his turn signal was flashing continuously because\nit was broken.\n4stopped automobile contains the odor of controlled substances, the officer has probable cause to\nbelieve that there are drugs in the automobile and may search it without a warrant.\u201d State v.\nGibson, 141 Idaho 277, 281, 108 P.3d 424, 428 (Ct. App. 2005).\nCaudill\u2019s allegations, however, may suggest an improper search because he suggests he\nmay not have opened his passenger door through which the drug dog alerted. Arguably, if the\nTrooper opened the door to facilitate the drug-dog sweep, that conduct might be a basis for\nsuppressing evidence. See, e.g., State v. Naranjo, 159 Idaho 258, 260, 359 P.3d 1055, 1057 (Ct.\nApp. 2015) (ruling inquiry is whether dog\u2019s act was instinctual and whether police facilitated or\nencouraged act). Caudill\u2019s suggestion that he did not open the door, however, is contrary to the\nrecord which indicates that Caudill opened the door and left it open. According to the Trooper\u2019s\nreport: \u201cBy opening the passenger door, Caudill retrieved the paperwork I requested. Caudill\nalso left the passenger door open.\u201d More importantly, Caudill\u2019s petition fails to allege that he\ninformed his trial counsel that Caudill disputed the Trooper\u2019s account of the search and that trial\ncounsel failed to act on that information. Indeed, Caudill makes no allegation of his trial\ncounsel\u2019s purported deficient performance.\nTo the contrary, Caudill indicated during his sentencing hearing that he was satisfied with\nhis counsel\u2019s representation. Further, Caudill did not raise the issue of who opened the\npassenger door during the hearing on his Rule 35 motion, despite challenging the nature of the\nTrooper\u2019s actions at that time. Instead, Caudill focused only on his belief that his truck did not\nmatch the description of the truck subject to the Amber Alert. Moreover, alleging that Caudill\ndisputed the Trooper\u2019s report of the search and that Caudill shared this information with his trial\ncounsel would not have required appointment of post-conviction counsel. Rather, these\npurported facts were within Caudill\u2019s personal knowledge and would not have required an\ninvestigation into facts not otherwise known to Caudill. See Melton, 148 Idaho at 342, 223 P.3d\nat 284 (noting inquiry focuses on whether appointed counsel is necessary to investigate facts not\nin the record).\nDespite giving Caudill every favorable inference, his petition fails to allege facts for a\nviable motion to suppress, of his trial counsel\u2019s alleged deficient performance, or of any resulting\nprejudice. As a result, Caudill\u2019s petition fails to allege even a possible claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 (1984) (requiring\nshowing of both counsel\u2019s deficiency and resulting prejudice to prevail on claim of ineffective\n5assistance of counsel); Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 60 (1985) (ruling petitioner\u2019s failure to\nallege prejudice prong of Strickland is basis for dismissal). For this reason, the district court\u2019s\nreliance on an incorrect legal standard to deny Caudill\u2019s petition was harmless and not a basis for\nremand. See Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 61 (requiring court to disregard error not affecting\nparty\u2019s substantial rights).\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\nDespite the district court\u2019s reliance on an incorrect legal standard, Caudill\u2019s petition fails\nto allege even a possibility of a valid claim for ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly,\nwe affirm the denial of his request for appointment of counsel and the summary dismissal of his\npetition.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge LORELLO CONCUR.\n6",

Telander,\nDefendant-Appellant. ) Judge, Presiding.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nJUSTICE BRIDGES delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Schostok and Hudson concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: The trial court did not err in dismissing defendant\u2019s second amended postconviction\npetition as untimely. Therefore, we affirmed.\n\u00b6 2 Defendant, Michael Alfonso, appeals the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the second amended\npetition that he filed pursuant to the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (Postconviction Act) (725 ILCS\n5/122-1 et seq. (West 2016)). We affirm.\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 We restate the facts of this case largely as set forth in our opinion resolving defendant\u2019s\nprior appeal. See People v. Alfonso, 2016 IL App (2d) 130568, \u00b6\u00b6 3-15.2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\n\u00b6 5 On July 3, 2001, defendant was charged with the first-degree murder (720 ILCS 5/9-1(a)\n(West 2000)) and aggravated stalking (725 ILCS 5/12-7.4(a)(1) (West 2000)) of Geneva\nVelasquez. Defendant was not apprehended and brought back to Illinois until 2005, after which\nthe State charged him by superseding indictment with multiple counts of first-degree murder and\nwith aggravated stalking.\n\u00b6 6 On November 4, 2005, following a fitness hearing, the trial court found defendant fit to\nstand trial. The same day, the State filed a notice of its intent to seek the imposition of the death\npenalty. Among other aggravating factors, the State alleged that defendant had also killed Sumnear\nYang on September 1, 1992.\n\u00b6 7 On June 29, 2007, the State and the defense indicated that they were close to a plea deal.\nAs part of the agreement, defendant was placed under oath and was examined in open court by the\nState\u2019s Attorney. Defendant admitted to killing Yang and Velasquez. He admitted that the only\nreason that he would agree to natural life imprisonment was to avoid the possibility of the death\npenalty. He also admitted faking a mental illness in 1994 and again in this case. He agreed that,\nfor purposes of entering a guilty plea, he would waive any right to appeal and to raise any issue in\npostconviction litigation in either state or federal court. He agreed that he would \u201cwaive any and\nall issues that [he] could ever have brought up throughout the rest of [his] life\u201d and that, if he ever\ntried to escape and \u201cbroke the agreement,\u201d the State could seek the death penalty against him.\n\u00b6 8 The parties formally entered into the plea agreement on July 11, 2007. As to Velasquez,\ndefendant pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and aggravated stalking, in return for natural life\nimprisonment for the former charge and a consecutive sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment for\nthe latter charge. As to Yang, defendant pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, intentional homicide\nof an unborn child, concealment of a homicidal death, and kidnapping. In return, he was to receive\n- 2 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\ntwo natural life sentences concurrent with the natural life sentence relating to Velasquez\u2019s case,\nand also five- and seven-year consecutive sentences that would be concurrent with each other.\n\u00b6 9 The trial court questioned defense counsel and heard the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s recitation of\nthe plea agreement, which included that defendant was waiving any appeals and all collateral\nattacks in state and federal court. The trial court then proceeded to admonish defendant. Defendant\nagreed that the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s recitation of the plea agreement was also his understanding of\nthe agreement. The trial court inquired into defendant\u2019s medication, mental state, and satisfaction\nwith counsel. He stated that he was able to understand the proceedings, fully discussed the case\nwith his counsel, and was satisfied with the representation that he had received. The trial court\nadmonished defendant of the charges, the sentencing ranges, and his right to a jury trial. Defendant\nwaived his right to a jury trial and pleaded guilty to the charges.\n\u00b6 10 The State presented a factual basis, to which defendant stipulated. The trial court again\nadmonished defendant as to the agreed-upon sentences. After admonishing defendant, the trial\ncourt found that defendant\u2019s pleas were voluntary; that he understood the nature of the charges and\nthe possible penalties that could be imposed; that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\nwaived his right to a jury trial; and that there was a sufficient factual basis for the pleas. It further\nfound that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and to\ncollaterally attack the judgments.\n\u00b6 11 Over five years later, on March 7, 2013, defendant filed a petition for relief from judgment\nunder section 2-1401 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 52-1401 (West 2012)), and a\npostconviction petition. In his section 2-1401 petition, defendant argued that his natural life\nsentence for Velasquez\u2019s death was void because it was beyond the statutory maximum of 60\nyears\u2019 imprisonment and because the State did not follow statutory procedures to obtain an\n- 3 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nextended term sentence. He also argued that his conviction of aggravated stalking was improper\nbecause his crime did not satisfy the statutory prerequisites and his conviction violated one-act,\none-crime principles.\n\u00b6 12 In his postconviction petition, defendant argued that his counsel was ineffective for failing\nto pursue a defense of mental illness, given that defendant had been diagnosed as mentally ill prior\nto the crimes, and for coercing defendant to plead guilty by assisting the State\u2019s Attorney in\nthreatening him with the death penalty, even though there was a death penalty moratorium at that\ntime.\n\u00b6 13 On March 20, 2013, the trial court held a hearing on the pleadings. The State stated that it\ndid not have a position on the postconviction petition, because 90 days had not yet passed since its\nfiling. The trial court stated that both of defendants\u2019 pleadings violated the plea agreement, and it\nstruck them.\n\u00b6 14 On appeal, we held that based on the record before us at the time, defendant\u2019s waiver was\nknowing, voluntary, and intentional. Alfonso, 2016 IL App (2d) 130568, \u00b6 35. We also rejected\ndefendant\u2019s argument that the remedy for his filing petitions in violation of the plea agreement\nshould have been vacating the agreement, rather than striking the petitions. Id. \u00b6 36. However, we\nheld that defendant could still file a postconviction petition alleging that counsel was ineffective\nin coercing him through incorrect legal advice to plead guilty, such that the trial court erred in\nstriking the petition without reviewing it. Id. \u00b6 38. Because the trial court had not determined\nwhether the petition was frivolous or patently without merit within 90 days of its docketing, we\nremanded for second-stage postconviction proceedings. Id. \u00b6 39. We also held that the trial court\nerred in striking defendant\u2019s section 2-1401 petition before 30 days had passed and before the State\n- 4 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nhad filed its response. Id. \u00b6 40. We therefore reversed its ruling and remanded for further\nproceedings on the section 2-1401 petition as well. Id.\n\u00b6 15 On remand, the trial court appointed postconviction counsel for defendant. On June 1,\n2016, it ordered that the State file its motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s section 2-1401 petition by June\n3, 2016, and that defendant would then have 45 days to respond. It further ordered that the petition\nwould be decided on the pleadings alone, without argument.\n\u00b6 16 In its motion to dismiss the section 2-1401 petition, the State argued that defendant\u2019s plea\nagreement prohibited him from filing collateral pleadings; that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to\ncollateral attacks was knowing, voluntary, and intentional; that defendant\u2019s claim of mental illness\nwas refuted by the record; that there was not merit to his claim that his guilty plea was involuntary\nbecause his counsel did not tell him there was a moratorium on the death penalty; that the State\nnotified defendant of its intention to seek the death penalty; and that defendant\u2019s convictions were\nnot void.\n\u00b6 17 On July 14, 2016, defendant filed a motion to withdraw his section 2-1401 petition. The\nState objected, arguing that defendant was attempting to avoid a dispositive ruling on the petition.\nOn July 20, 2016, the trial court denied defendant\u2019s request to withdraw his section 2-1401 petition\nand granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss it. The trial court stated that the plea agreement precluded\ndefendant from any collateral attacks on his convictions, and that his waiver of his rights was\nknowing, voluntary, and intentional, as stated in our appellate decision. The trial court further\nstated that defendant\u2019s claims were refuted by the record and by his own statements, including his\nstatement that he faked his mental illness. Finally, the trial court stated that it believed that defense\ncounsel correctly informed defendant that although there was a moratorium on the death penalty\nat the time, defendant could still be sentenced to death.\n- 5 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\n\u00b6 18 Defendant appealed, but this court dismissed the appeal after defendant failed to file a\ndocketing statement.\n\u00b6 19 On April 6, 2017, defendant filed an amended postconviction petition through counsel. He\nargued that his public defender was ineffective for several reasons, namely: for failing to object to\nthe factual basis; for failing to advise defendant that the method used in the bullet fragment analysis\nin the Yang case was no longer used by the FBI; for not properly advising him on the merits of the\nYang case; for pressuring him to accept the plea deal by telling him that a death sentence would\nbe inevitable; and for failing to demand that defendant be allowed to make a statement on his own\nbehalf, which also rendered the proceedings legally deficient. Defendant further argued that his\npublic defender was acting under a conflict of interest by advising him to accept reimbursement to\nthe public defendant\u2019s office from money in defendant\u2019s 401(k) account as part of the plea\nagreement.\n\u00b6 20 The State filed a motion to dismiss the amended postconviction petition on May 19, 2017.\nIt argued that the trial court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s section 2-1401 petition that defendant\nknowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to file collateral attacks on the judgment\noperated as res judicata on this issue. The State alternatively argued that the postconviction\npetition was untimely, in that it was filed more than three years from the date of conviction, and\nthat defendant did not argue that the delay was not due to his culpable negligence.\n\u00b6 21 Defendant filed a second amended petition for postconviction relief on August 24, 2017.\nDefendant additionally alleged that before and during the plea proceedings, he was suffering from\nsevere mental illnesses for which he was receiving powerful antipsychotic medications, which\ninterfered with his ability to understand and voluntarily enter into the plea agreement. Defendant\nalleged that the delay in filing the postconviction petition was not due to his culpable negligence\n- 6 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nbecause he had been threatened with the imposition of the death sentence if he contested the plea\nagreement, and because his mental illness interfered with his ability to understand how to prepare\nand present a petition.\n\u00b6 22 At a hearing on August 24, 2017, the State orally amended its motion to dismiss to apply\nto the second amended postconviction petition. Postconviction counsel argued that res judicata\ndid not apply because the ruling that defendant had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily\nwaived his right to collaterally attack the judgment occurred in the context of defendant\u2019s pro se\nsection 2-1401 petition, for which he did not have the benefit of counsel. He argued that defendant\nwas not culpably negligent in filing the postconviction petition late because he feared the death\npenalty if he challenged his guilty plea. Counsel argued that Illinois abolished the death penalty\neffective June 2011, and that defendant should have had three years from that time to file the\npetition. Finally, counsel argued that mental health issues prevented him from filing his petition\nearlier.\n\u00b6 23 The State argued that nothing prevented defendant from raising his claims in the first three\nyears of the judgment. It further argued that the trial court was aware of defendant\u2019s medications\nat the time it accepted his plea, and that defendant had previously been found fit to stand trial. Last,\nthe State argued that there was no case law that provided that a defendant must receive counsel in\nsection 2-1401 proceedings, and that trial courts routinely ruled upon their merits.\n\u00b6 24 The trial court stated that in ruling on the section 2-1401 petition, it found that defendant\nknowingly, intelligently,1 and voluntarily waived his rights to file a collateral attack based on the\n1 We note that when the trial court ruled on the section 2-1401 petition, it found that\ndefendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, voluntary, and \u201cintentional,\u201d as we had stated in our opinion\n- 7 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\ncourt file and the law, and the ruling had nothing to do with how artfully the section 2-1401 was\nwritten or how it was argued. It agreed with the State that the defense was barred by res judicata\non that issue, and it granted the State\u2019s motion to dismiss on this basis. The trial court also stated\nthat it agreed with the State that the postconviction petition was untimely.\n\u00b6 25 In its written order, the trial court stated that it was granting the State\u2019s motion to dismiss\nfor the reasons set forth in the record. It further stated: \u201cTHE COURT FINDS RES JUDICATA\nBARS DEFENDANT\u2019S AMENDED POST-CONVICTION PETITION. IT PREVIOUSLY\nRULED THAT DEFENDANT KNOWINGLY, INTELLIGENTLY, AND VOLUNTARILY\nWAIVED HIS RIGHT TO COLLATERAL ATTACKS.\u201d\n\u00b6 26 Defendant timely appealed.\n\u00b6 27 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 28 The Postconviction Act allows criminal defendants to make collateral attacks on their\nconvictions by asserting that their constitutional rights were substantially violated at trial. People\nv. Custer, 2019 IL 123339, \u00b6 29. It creates a three-stage process to adjudicate postconviction\npetitions. People v. Buffer, 2019 IL 122327, \u00b6 45. As relevant here, during the second stage of\nproceedings, the State may either answer the petition or move to dismiss the petition. 725 ILCS\n5/122-5 (West 2016); People v. Dupree, 2018 IL 122307, \u00b6 29. To survive dismissal, the petition\n(see Alfonso, 2016 IL App (2d) 130568, \u00b6 35), as opposed to \u201cintelligent.\u201d However, the waiver of\nconstitutional and statutory rights have also been judged under the standard of whether it was\nknowing, voluntary, and \u201cintelligent\u201d (see, e.g., People v. Lesley, 2018 IL 122100, \u00b6 50; People v.\nBannister, 232 Ill 2d. 52, 67 (2008)), so we treat both standards as the same for purposes of this\nappeal.\n- 8 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nmust make a \u201csubstantial showing\u201d of a deprivation of constitutional rights. Id. \u00b6 28. The trial court\nexamines the petition to determine its legal sufficiency, and it must accept as true any allegations\nnot affirmatively rebutted by the record. Id. \u00b6 29. Where, as in this case, the trial court dismisses a\npostconviction petition at the second stage, we review its ruling de novo. Id.\n\u00b6 29 The State\u2019s motion to dismiss argued res judicata and untimeliness. The Postconviction\nAct provides limitation periods for filing a petition, which include three years from the conviction\nif no appeal has been filed. 725 ILCS 5/122-1(c) (West 2016). However, section 122-1(c) allows\na defendant to bypass these time limitations by \u201calleg[ing] facts showing that the delay was not\ndue to his or her culpable negligence.\u201d Id.2 Culpable negligence is something more than ordinary\nnegligence, and it is akin to recklessness. People v. Johnson, 2017 IL 120310, \u00b6 26. It involves\n\u201c \u2018an indifference to, or disregard of, consequences.\u2019 \u201d People v. Boclair, 202 Ill. 2d 89, 106 (2002)\n(quoting 65 C.J.S. Negligence \u00a7 19 (2000)).\n\u00b6 30 On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court offered two justifications for dismissing the\npetition. First, the petition was barred by defendant\u2019s plea agreement, and any argument to the\ncontrary was barred by res judicata. Second, the petition was untimely, and the delay in its filing\nwas due to defendant\u2019s culpable negligence.\n\u00b6 31 Defendant argues that his postconviction petition made a substantial showing that it was\nnot barred by the plea agreement. However, both the report of proceedings and the trial court\u2019s\nwritten ruling show that the trial court did not make an independent finding during the\npostconviction proceedings that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his\n2 Although not applicable here, the time limitations also do not apply if the defendant\nclaims actual innocence. 725 ILCS 5/122-1(c) (West 2016)).\n- 9 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nright to collateral attacks. Instead, the trial court referred to the fact that it had previously made\nthis finding during the section 2-1401 proceedings, and it ruled that defendant\u2019s argument was\nbarred by res judicata.\n\u00b6 32 Defendant argues that the trial court\u2019s reliance on res judicata was incorrect because, in\ndismissing defendant\u2019s section 2-1401 petition, the trial court relied on our statement that\ndefendant\u2019s waiver was knowing, voluntary, and intentional. See supra \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17. Defendant\nmaintains that although we held that the trial court\u2019s plea admonishments were adequate, we did\nnot rule on whether defendant\u2019s guilty plea was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nDefendant cites our statement: \u201cWhile we acknowledge the presence of this claim, it is not our role\nto determine whether it is frivolous or patently without merit.\u201d Alfonso, 2016 IL App (2d) 130568,\n\u00b6 38. Defendant argues that the very fact that the case was remanded should have led the trial court\nto realize that we had not ruled on the issue.\n\u00b6 33 Defendant additionally argues that he alleged facts showing that the untimely filing was\nnot the result of his culpable negligence. Defendant notes that he pleaded guilty on July 11, 2007,\nand did not appeal his sentence. Under section 122-1(c) of the Postconviction Act (725 ILCS\n5/122-1(c) (West 2016)), his postconviction petition was due on July 11, 2010. He did not file it\nuntil March 7, 2013, but he argues that this delay was not due to his culpable negligence. Defendant\npoints to his argument that the same threat of execution that caused him to involuntarily plead\nguilty remained until \u201cJanuary 1, 2011,\u201d when Illinois abolished the death penalty.3 Defendant\nmaintains that this allegation was sufficient to excuse his late filing under People v. Knight, 405\nIll. App. 3d 461, 465 (2010), where the defendant filed his postconviction petition more than six\n3 The death penalty was abolished effective July 1, 2011. 725 ILCS 5/119-1 (West 2012).\n- 10 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nyears late. In that case, the defendant alleged that he could file the petition only after the death of\nthe gang leader who controlled the prison and had arranged the defendant\u2019s guilty plea. The\ndefendant alleged that gang witnesses were now willing to come forward because they no longer\nfeared being killed. Defendant argues that his situation is similar to Knight because the threat that\ncaused him to plead guilty continued until long after the due date for his petition.\n\u00b6 34 Defendant argues that the terms of his plea agreement additionally contributed to his late\nfiling, because he was told by both the prosecutor and the judge that he had no right to challenge\nhis plea in any way. Defendant maintains that these statements were incorrect, as shown by our\nholding that he could file a postconviction claim that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary.\nSee Alfonso, 2016 IL App (2d) 130568, \u00b6 38. He argues that he alleged in his pro se postconviction\npetition that his trial attorney never told him that the statements were erroneous. Defendant\nanalogizes this case to People v. Rissley, 206 Ill. 2d 403, 421 (2006), where the supreme court held\nthat the defendant was not culpably negligent in filing his postconviction petition late, because the\ndefendant\u2019s appellate counsel incorrectly advised him of the due date.\n\u00b6 35 The State maintains that defendant has forfeited his last argument because he did not raise\nthese allegations in his second amended postconviction petition as reasons for his late filing. We\nagree. Regardless of what defendant alleged in his pro se postconviction petition, it was\nsuperseded by defendant\u2019s second amended postconviction petition. See People v. Phelps, 51 Ill.\n2d 35, 38 (1972) (the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel brought up in the defendant\u2019s pro se\npostconviction petition was not before the court because it was not included in the amended\npetition filed by appointed counsel); Barnett v. Zion Park District, 171 Ill. 2d 378, 384 (1996)\n(\u201cWhere an amended pleading is complete in itself and does not refer to or adopt the prior pleading,\nthe earlier pleading ceases to be part of the record for most purposes and is effectively abandoned\n- 11 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\nand withdrawn.\u201d). Defendant\u2019s second amended postconviction petition did not claim that\nallegedly incorrect statements by the prosecutor and trial court, along with the failure of his trial\ncounsel to inform him of the falsity of the remarks, caused him to file his postconviction petition\nlate, so we do not consider these allegations.\n\u00b6 36 The State further argues that there is no support for defendant\u2019s argument that he could not\nseek to withdraw his guilty plea until the death penalty was abolished. The State argues that,\ninstead, defendant\u2019s fear as a result of his own actions of murdering two people does not excuse\nan untimely petition. The State argues that this situation is distinguishable from Knight because\nthere were no external forces or individuals threating him or forcing him to plea guilty. According\nto the State, defendant chose not to timely-file a postconviction petition because he knew that if\nhe succeeded in his claims, his crimes subjected him to a more serious sentencing range. The State\nargues that defendant instead waited until the law changed and became more advantageous to his\nposition.\n\u00b6 37 The State maintains that even if defendant was not culpably negligent in waiting to file his\npostconviction petition until the death penalty was abolished, the death penalty was abolished on\nJuly 1, 2011 (725 ILCS 5/119-1 (West 2012)), and defendant did not file his petition until \u201c26\nmonths\u201d later.4 The State cites People v. Davis, 351 Ill. App. 3d 215, 218 (2004), where the court\nstated, \u201cwhether delay is due to culpable negligence depends not only on when the claim is\ndiscovered but on how promptly the defendant takes action after the discovery.\u201d The State\nhighlights that in Davis, this court held that the defendant\u2019s claim was untimely where he waited\n4 Defendant filed his postconviction petition on March 7, 2013, which is about 20 months\nafter July 1, 2011.\n- 12 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\ntwo years after discovering his claim to file his petition. Id. It also cites People v. Ramirez, 361 Ill.\nApp. 3d 450, 453-54 (2005), where this court held that the defendant\u2019s postconviction petition was\nuntimely where he waited 40 months after the case that was the basis for his petition was filed.\nThe State argues that, similarly, defendant offers no explanation as to why he waited more than\ntwo years after the abolishment of the death penalty to file his petition, rendering the petition\nuntimely.\n\u00b6 38 The State additionally argues that the trial court correctly applied res judicata, because it\nhad already ruled in the section 2-1401 proceedings that defendant had failed to show that his\nwaiver and guilty plea were involuntary. It alternatively argues that defendant\u2019s claim is barred by\ncollateral estoppel. Finally, the State argues that dismissal is warranted even if we were to reach\nthe merits of defendant\u2019s claims.\n\u00b6 39 We agree with the State that dismissal was justified because the postconviction petition\nwas untimely, and defendant failed to allege facts showing that the delay was not due to his\nculpable negligence. Even accepting that defendant would not have been culpably negligent until\nthe death penalty was abolished, that occurred effective July 1, 2011 (725 ILCS 5/119-1 (West\n2012)). The public act abolishing the death penalty was approved earlier, on March 9, 2011. P.A.\n96-1543, \u00a7 10, eff. July 1, 2011. Defendant filed his postconviction petition on March 7, 2013,\nabout 20 months after the effective date, and about two years after the public act was approved.\nHe offers no explanation for this delay, contrary to the section 122-1(c)\u2019s requirement that\ndefendant \u201callege[ ] facts showing that the delay was not due to his or her culpable negligence.\u201d\n725 ILCS 5/122-1(c) (West 2016).\n\u00b6 40 Cases reviewing postconviction petitions with similar delays have concluded that they were\nuntimely. As the State points out, Davis involved a delay of two years, and Ramirez involved a\n- 13 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\ndelay of 40 months, without an explanation by the defendants. Davis, 351 Ill. App. 3d at 218;\nRamirez, 361 Ill. App. 3d at 453-54. In People v. Gerow, 388 Ill. App. 3d 524, 531 (2009), the\ncourt stated that \u201c[t]he allowance of a postconviction petition more than 26 months after the timely\nfiling deadline without excuse is unprecedented in Illinois.\u201d We recognize that in People v.\nWilburn, 338 Ill. App. 3d 1075, 1078 (2009), the court held that the defendant\u2019s postconviction\npetition was not untimely where he filed it within 16 months of the issuance of a case. However,\nGerow stated that the \u201cWilburn court did not explain its reasoning for its decision that a 16-month\ndelay did not constitute culpable negligence.\u201d Gerow, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 529; see also Johnson,\n2017 IL 120310, \u00b6 26 (ignorance of the law or legal rights is not an excuse to delay bringing a\nlawsuit). Additionally, this case involves a longer delay than Wilburn, especially considering that\nthe public act abolishing the death penalty was approved months before the effective date.\n\u00b6 41 Defendant additionally alleged that he was not culpably negligent because his mental\nillness interfered with his ability to understand how to prepare and present a petition. However,\nthis allegation is rebutted by the record, in that defendant was found fit to stand trial in 2005; in\n2007 the trial court inquired into his medications and mental state before accepting his guilty plea;\nand during the same proceedings, defendant admitted faking a mental illness in 1994 and also in\nthis case. Defendant does not make any allegations that his mental health changed after 2007, or\nexplain why it would amount to a 20-month delay in filing the petition. Accordingly, the trial court\ndid not err in dismissing defendant\u2019s second amended postconviction petition as untimely.\n\u00b6 42 Based on our resolution, we do not address defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred\nin dismissing his petition as also barred by res judicata, nor do we examine the State\u2019s additional\nasserted bases for affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling.\n\u00b6 43 III. CONCLUSION\n- 14 -2020 IL App (2d) 170668-U\n\u00b6 44 For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the Du Page County circuit court.\n\u00b6 45 Affirmed.\n- 15 -",

BANKS,\nAppellant\nv.\nED LEA; JIM BUCKLEY; KIMBERLY GREWAY; ORLANDO L. HARPER;\nJUDGE CATHY BISSOON; JIM HIMHOLF\n____________________________________\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Pennsylvania\n(D.C. Civil Action No. 2-19-cv-00942)\nDistrict Judge: Honorable Nora B. Fischer\n____________________________________\nSubmitted for Possible Summary Action Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and\nI.O.P. 10.6 and Consideration of Whether a Certificate of Appealability is Required\nFebruary 6, 2020\nBefore: JORDAN, KRAUSE and MATEY, Circuit Judges\n(Opinion filed: February 11, 2020)\n_________\nOPINION*\n_________\nPER CURIAM\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.Frederick H. Banks appeals from the September 30, 2019 order of the United\nStates District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, which dismissed his\npetition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241; he also appeals from the order denying his motion\nto vacate the September 30 order. Because no substantial question is presented by this\nappeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.1 See Third Circuit LAR\n27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\nBanks, who was a pretrial detainee at the time, filed his petition in the United\nStates District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. In the petition, he raised\ntwo claims: (1) certain prison officials violated his constitutional rights by not allowing\ndelivery of religious (wicca) books or magazines that he had ordered; and (2) the prison\nchaplain\u2019s office discriminated against him by failing to confirm a wicca religious meal\nfor Banks and by raising barriers to a religious visit from a wicca volunteer.\nThe Magistrate Judge recommended that the petition be dismissed because Banks\nis subject to vexatious-litigant orders (\u201cVLO\u201d) and he had not obtained authorization\nfrom the District Court to file the petition.2 The District Court adopted the\n1 Because Banks\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition was not a true habeas petition, no certificate of\nappealability is required for this appeal.\n2 The VLOs were entered in two of Banks\u2019 other actions, W.D. Civ. Nos. 15-cv-01400\nand 15-cv-01385, as expanded by an order in a criminal case, W.D. Crim. No. 15-cr-\n00174, in which Banks filed a habeas petition and motions as \u201cnext friend\u201d of the\ndefendant. In the civil actions, the District Court enjoined Banks from filing any\ncomplaint, lawsuit, or mandamus petition without authorization of the District Court.\nBanks\u2019 appeal from that order was dismissed for failing to pay the filing fee. C.A. No.\n15-3989. In the criminal action, the District Court extended its VLO \u201cto all filings made\n2recommendation and dismissed the petition on September 30. Banks filed a \u201cNotice of\nAppeal and Motion to Vacate Memorandum Order.\u201d Banks argued that the September 30\norder should be vacated because he never received the Report and Recommendation and\nthus did not have a chance to object. He also indicated that he was appealing the\nSeptember 30 dismissal.\nOn October 9, 2019, the District Court denied the motion to the extent that Banks\nsought reconsideration of the September 30 order, declined to take any action to the\nextent that Banks had already appealed to this Court, and furnished Banks with a copy of\nthe Report and Recommendation. Banks then filed an amended notice of appeal,\nappealing the October 9 order.\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201c[T]his Court has made clear that a\npattern of groundless and vexatious litigation will justify an order prohibiting further\nfilings without permission of the court.\u201d Chipps v. U.S. Dist. Court for the Middle Dist.\nof Pa., 882 F.2d 72, 73 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Gagliardi v. McWilliams, 834 F.2d 81 (3d\nCir. 1987); In re: Oliver, 682 F.2d 443 (3d Cir. 1982)). Having reviewed the record, we\nconclude that the District Court correctly held that Banks\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition was barred in\nits entirety by the District Court\u2019s VLOs.\nby Mr. Banks, in his name or under his known alias(es), whether on his behalf or on\nbehalf of anyone else.\u201d Oct. 3, 2017 Order, W.D. Crim. No. 15-cr-00174. The District\nCourt noted that the order did not apply to filings in Banks\u2019 active criminal case. Banks\nappealed and we affirmed the District Court\u2019s order. United States v. Miller, 726 F.\nApp\u2019x, 107, 108 (3d Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (non-precedential).\n3Banks claims that the VLOs do not apply to habeas petitions. But Banks sought to\nchallenge the conditions of his pretrial confinement; his petition did not \u201cqualify as\nattacking the fact, duration, or execution of a sentence.\u201d See Velazquez v. Sup\u2019t Fayette\nSCI, 937 F.3d 151, 158 (3d Cir. 2019). Thus, Banks did not properly bring his claims in\na habeas petition rather than a civil rights complaint. Cf. Cardona v. Bledsoe, 681 F.3d\n533, 537-38 (3d Cir. 2012) (affirming District Court\u2019s dismissal for lack of jurisdiction of\n\u00a7 2241 petition that failed to raise claims challenging the execution of the petitioner\u2019s\nsentence). Of course, Banks would need to have advance authorization from the District\nCourt before filing a civil rights complaint. His petition here is a clear attempt to\ncircumvent the VLO.\nThe District Court properly dismissed Banks\u2019 petition as violating the VLO. We\nalso agree that Banks\u2019 Motion to Vacate raised no valid reasons for vacating the\nSeptember 30 order. For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s orders.\n4",

RUNKER,\nANDREW CECERE,\nFLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL,\nDefendants-Appellees.\n________________________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Florida\n________________________\n(February 7, 2020)Case: 19-10568 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 2 of 3\nBefore WILSON, NEWSOM, and BRANCH, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\nRenee Bell, proceeding pro se, appeals the dismissal of her complaint with\nprejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) alleging constitutional violations by the\nU.S. Bank National Association, the Oaks at Powers Park Homeowners\nAssociation, the Florida Highway Patrol, and several individuals. Among other\nthings, Bell appears to contend that U.S. Bank conspired with the other defendants\nto fraudulently foreclose on her property and prevent her from filing for\nbankruptcy. On appeal, she asserts that the district court violated her constitutional\nrights by dismissing her complaint and that the court shouldn\u2019t have considered her\ncomplaint frivolous because decisive facts may not have emerged until discovery\nor trial.1\nIf a party fails to object to the findings or recommendations contained in an\nreport and recommendation (R&R) after being informed of the time period for\nobjecting and the consequences on appeal for failing to object, that party waives\nthe right to challenge the unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions on appeal.\n11th Cir. R. 3-1. Furthermore, if a pro se litigant fails to address an issue in her\nopening brief, that issue is deemed abandoned. Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d 870,\n1 The dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nBilal v. Driver, 251 F.3d 1346, 1348\u201349 (11th Cir. 2001).\n2Case: 19-10568 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 3 of 3\n874 (11th Cir. 2008). Here, Bell waived her right to challenge the district court\u2019s\nfactual and legal conclusions because she didn\u2019t object to the substance of the\nR&R. She also abandoned any argument that the district court erred in dismissing\nher complaint with prejudice because she did not argue that issue in her brief.\nAdditionally, we have held that a district court doesn\u2019t violate due process in\ndismissing a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) where the litigant is given an opportunity\nto object to the R&R and the district court reviews the R&R de novo. Vanderberg\nv. Donaldson, 259 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 2001). So, to the extent that Bell\nargues that the dismissal violated due process, her argument fails because she was\ngiven an opportunity to object to the R&R, which the court reviewed de novo.\nFinally, motions to dismiss based on a facial challenge to the complaint\nshould be resolved before discovery begins. Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp.,\n123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997). Therefore, to the extent that Bell asserts that\nshe couldn\u2019t file a proper complaint without discovery, the district court\ndetermined that her claims were facially frivolous and, therefore, properly\ndismissed the matter before discovery.\nAFFIRMED.\n3",

Claps,\nTOMMY JOHNSON, ) Judge presiding.\n)\nDefendant-Appellant. )\nPRESIDING JUSTICE GRIFFIN delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Hyman and Pierce concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: Defendant\u2019s conviction for possessing contraband in a penal institution is affirmed\nwhere the trial court did not admit hearsay testimony.\n\u00b6 2 Following a bench trial, defendant Tommy Johnson was convicted of possessing\ncontraband in a penal institution (720 ILCS 5/31A-1.1(b) (West 2012)) pursuant to an incident in\na Cook County Department of Corrections (CCDOC) jail on February 11, 2014. He appeals,\narguing that the trial court erroneously admitted hearsay testimony. We affirm.\n\u00b6 3 Kevin Meller testified that on February 11, 2014, he was a Cook County corrections officer\nworking at the CCDOC Ninth Division, a \u201csuper maximum security\u201d jail. Meller\u2019s commandingNo. 1-17-0585\nofficers instructed him to search cell 2231 on Tier 2F. He verified with the tier officer that\ndefendant was assigned to the cell, and, with other officers, formulated a plan to search the cell\nwhile defendant was the sole occupant. Meller entered the cell block approximately 20 to 25 feet\naway from defendant\u2019s cell, ran to the front of the cell, and opened the door. As he entered, he saw\ndefendant \u201cleaning over the bunk\u201d as if \u201che was throwing something.\u201d\n\u00b6 4 Meller handcuffed defendant and removed him from the cell, then returned to the cell and\nsearched under the bunk bed. He found a \u201csharpened metal object\u201d and a bag containing documents\nand personal effects. Meller could not tell what defendant had held in his hand, but it did not\nresemble the documents. Meller identified the metal object in court, and stated it appeared to be\nmade from an \u201casthma pump.\u201d Nothing else was underneath the bunk. From the time Meller\nreceived his assignment until the time he entered cell 2231, he did not see anyone besides\ndefendant in the cell.\n\u00b6 5 The State introduced People\u2019s Group Exhibit 1 (Exhibit 1), a document showing\ndefendant\u2019s bed assignments in the jail. Using Exhibit 1, Meller confirmed that on February 11,\n2014, defendant was housed in cell 2231. Meller further testified, over defense counsel\u2019s objection,\nthat Exhibit 1 shows CCDOC moved defendant to Tier 1F, a disciplinary segregation unit, on\nFebruary 19, 2014. Exhibit 1 was admitted into evidence without objection.1\n\u00b6 6 On cross-examination, Meller stated that the cell door was remotely unlocked for him. He\ndid not know the last time defendant\u2019s cellmate was in the cell prior to the search. Meller did not\nrecover or inventory any other items besides the metal object. He did not inventory the contents of\nthe bag because they were \u201cpersonal effects,\u201d and he \u201cwent in [the cell] for one reason.\u201d\n1 Exhibit 1 is not included in the record on appeal.\n- 2 -No. 1-17-0585\n\u00b6 7 On redirect, Meller stated that the metal object was small enough to fit in defendant\u2019s hand.\nOn recross-examination, Meller admitted he stopped searching the cell after he recovered the metal\nobject.\n\u00b6 8 Following closing arguments, the court found defendant guilty of possessing contraband\nin a penal institution, stating it considered the \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201carguments,\u201d and \u201c[i]n [its]\njudgment,\u201d the State proved the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The court denied defendant\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider and for a new trial. After a hearing, the court sentenced defendant to four\nyears and four months\u2019 imprisonment and denied his motion to reconsider sentence.\n\u00b6 9 On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred by admitting evidence that contained\nimplicit hearsay assertions. Specifically, defendant complains of Meller\u2019s testimony (1) regarding\nplanning the search, (2) that he \u201cwent in [the cell] for one reason,\u201d and (3) that defendant was\nmoved to disciplinary segregation following the incident.\n\u00b6 10 Defendant only objected to the transfer testimony at trial and did not raise any of these\nissues in his posttrial motion. As such, defendant\u2019s arguments are forfeited. See People v. Staake,\n2017 IL 121755, \u00b6 30 (\u201cTo preserve a claim of error for consideration by a reviewing court, a\ndefendant must object to the error at trial and raise the error in a posttrial motion.\u201d). Defendant\nconcedes this point but contends that plain error review is appropriate.\n\u00b6 11 A reviewing court can consider issues not properly preserved on plain error review \u201cwhen\na clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone\nthreatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the\nerror,\u201d or \u201cwhen a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the\nfairness of the defendant\u2019s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of\n- 3 -No. 1-17-0585\nthe closeness of the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) People v. Coats, 2018 IL\n121926, \u00b6 9. Defendant contends the first prong applies. We must first determine whether a clear\nor obvious error occurred. People v. Sebby, 2017 IL 119445, \u00b6 49.\n\u00b6 12 The rule against hearsay is rooted in a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the\nwitnesses against him. U.S. Const., amend. VI. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for\nthe truth of the matter asserted. People v. Peterson, 2017 IL 120331, \u00b6 17. \u201cA \u2018statement\u2019 is (1) an\noral or written assertion or (2) nonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an\nassertion.\u201d Ill. R. Evid. 801(a) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015). In addition to the constitutional concerns,\nhearsay evidence is also \u201cgenerally inadmissible due to its lack of reliability.\u201d People v. Olinger,\n176 Ill. 2d 326, 357 (1997).\n\u00b6 13 A trial court\u2019s ruling on whether to admit evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nPeople v. Becker, 239 Ill. 2d 215, 234 (2010). \u201cTo establish an abuse of discretion, defendant must\npersuade us that the trial court\u2019s decision *** was arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable or *** no\nreasonable man would take the view adopted by the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks\nomitted.) People v. Patterson, 2014 IL 115102, \u00b6 114.\n\u00b6 14 As noted, defendant did not object to some of the statements he now challenges on appeal,\nmeaning the trial court did not rule thereon. In a bench trial, however, the trial court is presumed\nto have \u201cconsidered only admissible evidence and disregarded inadmissible evidence in reaching\nits conclusion.\u201d People v. Naylor, 229 Ill. 2d 584, 603 (2008). This presumption can be rebutted\nby \u201caffirmative evidence in the record.\u201d People v. Simon, 2011 IL App (1st) 091197, \u00b6 91.\n\u00b6 15 Defendant first argues that Meller\u2019s testimony regarding the plan to search cell 2231 when\ndefendant was the sole occupant leads to the improper hearsay inference that a nontestifying\n- 4 -No. 1-17-0585\ndeclarant told Meller she suspected defendant had contraband. Defendant further contends that\nMeller\u2019s comment that he entered the cell \u201cfor one reason\u201d also leads to this inference.\n\u00b6 16 Meller\u2019s complained-of testimony, however, does not constitute hearsay because the\nremarks do not contain out-of-court statements. First, Meller\u2019s testimony that he planned with\nother officers to conduct the search when defendant was the cell\u2019s sole occupant appropriately\nrelayed the facts of his own conduct before and during the search. Second, Meller\u2019s testimony that\nhe went in the cell \u201cfor one reason\u201d explained why he did not inventory items not considered\ncontraband. This testimony did not relay any oral or written statements or nonverbal assertions\nfrom a nontestifying witness. Ill. R. Evid. 801(a) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015).\n\u00b6 17 Even accepting defendant\u2019s premise that these statements contain implicit assertions from\nnontestifying witnesses, however, a reasonable factfinder could find that the statements were\nadmissible as nonhearsay course-of-investigation testimony. Law enforcement officers are\npermitted to testify as to out-of-court statements for the limited purpose of explaining the course\nof their investigation. People v. Banks, 237 Ill. 2d 154, 181 (2010). This is because the course of\nthe investigation is within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge. People v. Peoples, 377 Ill. App. 3d\n978, 984 (2007). \u201c \u2018Testimony describing the progress of the investigation is admissible even if it\nsuggests that a nontestifying witness implicated the defendant.\u2019 \u201d People v. Ochoa, 2017 IL App\n(1st) 140204, \u00b6 40 (quoting People v. Simms, 143 Ill. 2d 154, 174 (1991)). This limited exception\ncannot be used to admit the substance of conversations the officer had with nontestifying\ndeclarants. Ochoa, 2017 IL App (1st) 140204, \u00b6 41.\n\u00b6 18 Here, Meller\u2019s testimony explained his own conduct in planning and executing the search.\nThis makes both the search planning and the \u201cone reason\u201d testimony admissible for course-of-\n- 5 -No. 1-17-0585\ninvestigation purposes, even if the trial court inferred from the testimony that a nontestifying\nwitness implicated defendant during the investigation. See Simms, 143 Ill. 2d at 174; see also\nOchoa, 2017 IL App (1st) 140204, \u00b6 41. The present matter is distinguishable from People v.\nVirgin, 302 Ill. App. 3d 438 (1998), cited by defendant, where testimony that a search warrant\ncontained a description of a suspect that resembled the defendant was found improper. See Virgin,\n302 Ill. App. 3d at 446-47. Here, none of the complained-of testimony contains the substance of\nout-of-court statements. Thus, we find that the trial court did not err in admitting the testimony\nregarding the search planning or Meller\u2019s \u201cone reason\u201d statement.\n\u00b6 19 Defendant next argues that the State introduced evidence regarding his transfer to\ndisciplinary segregation for an impermissible hearsay purpose. Meller testified, based on Exhibit\n1, that defendant was transferred to a disciplinary unit eight days after the search. Defendant\ncontends that this testimony improperly suggests that a nontestifying prison official concluded\ndefendant possessed contraband.\n\u00b6 20 We find that the court did not commit clear or obvious error in admitting this evidence.\nFirst, Exhibit 1 contained defendant\u2019s transfer information. Defendant did not object to the exhibit\nbeing entered into evidence and does not challenge its admissibility on appeal. Meller relayed that\ninformation to the court and explained that 1F is a disciplinary segregation cell block. Meller did\nnot relay any third-party statements suggesting what precipitated the transfer. This issue can be\nresolved on this basis alone.\n\u00b6 21 Second, the fact of defendant\u2019s transfer does not necessarily implicitly assert that a\nnontestifying witness believed that defendant possessed contraband. Cf. People v. Orr, 149 Ill.\nApp. 3d 348, 362 (1986) (testimony that nontestifying witnesses chased a defendant constituted\n- 6 -No. 1-17-0585\nan improper hearsay assertion that the nontestifying witnesses believed the defendant committed\na crime). The evidence supports the conclusion that the search and recovery did in fact occur,\nwhich would corroborate Meller\u2019s testimony against claims of fabrication. Whatever the intended\npurpose of this evidence, defendant has the burden of demonstrating that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in allowing it. Defendant has not met this burden.\n\u00b6 22 Because the court did not commit clear or obvious error, plain error review is inappropriate,\nand defendant\u2019s procedural default of his hearsay arguments will not be excused. His conviction\nis therefore affirmed.\n\u00b6 23 Affirmed.\n- 7 -",

Following a three-day jury\ntrial, Mulkin was found guilty of the above-mentioned crimes on April 3, 2019.\nOn April 10, 2019, after considering a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report,\nthe trial court sentenced Mulkin to 18-36 months\u2019 imprisonment for\ninvoluntary manslaughter, an aggravated-range sentence,6 and imposed\nstandard-range sentences of 9-18 months\u2019 imprisonment for delivery of a\ndesigner drug7 and 9-18 months\u2019 imprisonment for criminal use of a\ncommunication facility. The trial court stated on the record that an\naggravated-range sentence on the involuntary manslaughter count was\njustified because Mulkin delivered drugs he knew to have recently caused\nothers to overdose,8 and because Mulkin had previously been caught with\ncontrolled substances while incarcerated for drug possession.\n____________________________________________\n5 Furanylfentanyl is a derivative of the synthetic opioid, Fentanyl. N.T. Trial,\n6/20/19, at 200-23. Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine,\nand furanylfentanyl is slightly less potent than Fentanyl. Id.\n6 With an offense gravity score (OGS) of 6 for involuntary manslaughter and\nMulkin\u2019s prior record score (PRS) of 0, the standard-range minimum sentence\nat that count was 3-12 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the aggravated range\nminimum was 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a).\n7 For sentencing purposes, Mulkin\u2019s conviction for delivery of a controlled\nsubstance merged delivery of a designer drug.\n8 In May of 2016, Mulkin purchased several baggies of furanylfentanyl, which\nhe thought contained heroin, for himself and Whitesell. N.T. Trial, 4/1/19 at\n121-22. At the time of purchase, Mulkin was told that other drug users had\nrecently overdosed after ingesting that particular batch of drugs. Id. at 121.\n- 2 -J-S68026-19\nOn April 18, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely motion to modify sentence which\nthe trial court denied on May 2, 2019. On May 11, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely\nnotice of appeal followed by a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal. He presents the following issue\nfor our consideration: \u201cDid the [s]entencing [c]ourt abuse [its] discretion by\nrelying on inappropriate factors and by ignoring mitigating evidence when it\naggravated [Mulkin\u2019s] sentence beyond the standard range?\u201d Brief for\nAppellant, at 5.\nMulkin\u2019s claim represents a challenge to the discretionary aspects of his\nsentence. Commonwealth v. Prestidge, 539 A.2d 439, 441 (Pa. Super.\n1988). An appeal raising the discretionary aspects of sentencing is not\nguaranteed as of right; rather, it is considered a petition for permission to\nappeal. Commonwealth v. Williams, 562 A.2d 1385, 1386-87 (Pa. Super.\n1989) (en banc). In order to reach the merits of a discretionary aspects claim,\nwe must engage in a four-part analysis to determine:\n(1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see\nPa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly\npreserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify\nsentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P. [720]; (3) whether appellant\u2019s brief\nhas a fatal defect, Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a\nsubstantial question that the sentence appealed from is not\nappropriate under the Sentencing Code.\n* * *\n____________________________________________\nAccordingly, Mulkin advised Whitesell upon delivering the drugs not to inject\nthem intravenously \u201cbecause [he] was told that it was a potent batch of\nheroin.\u201d Id. at 124.\n- 3 -J-S68026-19\nThe determination of what constitutes a substantial question must\nbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A substantial question\nexists only when the appellant advances a colorable argument\nthat the sentencing judge\u2019s actions were either: (1) inconsistent\nwith a specific provision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary\nto the fundamental norms which underlie the sentencing process.\nCommonwealth v. Griffin, 65 A.3d 932, 935-36 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citations\nand quotations omitted).\nHere, Mulkin filed a post-sentence motion to modify his sentence, a\ntimely notice of appeal, and included in his brief a concise statement of\nreasons relied upon for appeal pursuant to Rule 2119(f). Additionally, Mulkin\nraises a substantial question by asserting the sentencing court relied on an\nimpermissible factor and ignored mitigating evidence when imposing an\naggravated-range sentence for involuntary manslaughter. See\nCommonwealth v. Roden, 730 A.2d 995 (Pa. Super. 1999) (sentencing\ncourt relying on impermissible factor raises substantial question); see also\nCommonwealth v. Felmlee, 828 A.2d 1105, 1107 (Pa. Super. 2003)\n(imposition of aggravated-range sentence without considering mitigating\nfactors raises substantial question).\nWe, therefore, address Mulkin\u2019s claim, which raises two arguments:\nfirst, that the court erred by relying on an impermissible factor, and second,\nthat the court erred by ignoring mitigating evidence.9\n____________________________________________\n9 Mulkin contends that the court failed to consider, inter alia, (1) positive\ncharacter references from his mother, former employer, and lifelong family\nfriend; (2) that he graduated from high school; (3) his strong work ethic; (4)\nhis sincere remorse; and (5) that his criminal history is limited to non-violent\ndrug offenses. See Brief of Appellant, at 14-17.\n- 4 -J-S68026-19\nWe note that when imposing sentence, the trial court is granted broad\ndiscretion, as it is in the best position to determine the proper penalty for a\nparticular offense based upon an evaluation of the individual circumstances\nbefore it. Commonwealth v. Walls, 926 A.2d 957, 961 (Pa. 2017). We are\nalso cognizant of the fact that the trial court considered a PSI before imposing\nMulkin\u2019s sentence. Commonwealth v. Ventura, 975 A.2d 1128, 1135 (Pa.\nSuper. 2009) (sentencing court informed by PSI presumed aware of relevant\nfactors).\nMulkin\u2019s first argument is waived, as he fails to reference any legal\nauthority for the proposition that the sentencing court abused its discretion by\nimpermissibly relying on his drug-related prison infraction while incarcerated\non unrelated drug possession charges as a reason to aggravate his sentence.\nBrief of Appellant, at 13; see Pa.R.A.P. 2119(b) (party must direct court\u2019s\nattention to specific authority relied upon); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 985\nA.2d 915, 924 (Pa. 2009) (\u201c[W]here an appellate brief fails to provide any\ndiscussion of a claim with citation to relevant authority or fails to develop the\nissue in any meaningful fashion capable of review, that claim is waived.\u201d).\nWe, therefore, consider only the portion of Mulkin\u2019s claim relating to the\nsentencing court\u2019s alleged failure to \u201cconsider the mitigating evidence\npresented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Brief of Appellant, at 12.\nWe have repeatedly held that where a sentencing court has the benefit\nof a PSI, the court is presumed to have weighed all relevant information\nregarding the defendant\u2019s character against any mitigating factors.\n- 5 -J-S68026-19\nCommonwealth v. Moury, 992 A.2d 162, 171 (Pa. Super. 2010). As the\nsentencing judge considered a PSI before imposing sentence, Mulkin\u2019s\nargument that the court ignored mitigating evidence is without merit.\nMoreover, this argument is belied by the record, as the sentencing judge noted\nafter hearing all of the mitigating evidence that Mulkin had been a \u201cgood young\nm[a]n\u201d before his involvement with drugs. N.T. Sentencing, 4/10/19, at 35.\nIt is well-settled that where \u201cthe sentencing court proffers reasons\nindicating that its decision to depart from the guidelines is not unreasonable,\nthe sentence will be upheld.\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 863 A.2d 1172,\n1177-78 (Pa. Super. 2004). See Commonwealth v. Walls, 926 A.2d 957\n(Pa. 2007) (noting difficulty of defining inquiry into reasonableness of\nsentence). Based on the record, we cannot conclude that Mulkin\u2019s sentence\nis manifestly unreasonable. The sentencing court proffered sufficient reasons\nindicating why it decided to sentence Mulkin in the aggravated range on the\ninvoluntary manslaughter count.\nWe, however, sua sponte examine the legality of Mulkin\u2019s sentence with\nrespect to the court\u2019s decision to determine the amount and method of\npayment of restitution at a later date. See Commonwealth v. Ramos, 197\nA.3d 766, 768-69 (Pa. Super. 2018) (court\u2019s authority to impose restitution\nimplicates legality of sentence); Commonwealth v. Infante, 63 A.3d 358,\n363 (Pa. Super. 2013) (this Court may consider legality of sentence sua\nsponte). A challenge to the legality of sentence raises a question of law.\nCommonwealth v. Smith, 956 A.2d 1029, 1033 (Pa. Super. 2008) (en\n- 6 -J-S68026-19\nbanc). Our standard of review, therefore, is de novo and the scope of our\nreview is plenary. Commonwealth v. Childs, 63 A.3d 323, 325 (Pa. Super.\n2013).\nAt Mulkin\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court ordered Mulkin to \u201cpay the\ncosts of court [sic] as determined in a separate hearing.\u201d N.T. Sentencing,\n4/10/19, at 39. In a supplemental Rule 1925(a) opinion, the sentencing judge\nnoted:\nRight before sentencing, the Commonwealth filed for a large\namount of costs and restitution and furnished a large packet of\ndocuments relating to those claims. Much of the amount claimed\nrelated to expert witness costs and fees. The [c]ourt erroneously,\nand without objection from either party, decided to set a separate\nrestitution hearing[10] due to the complexity and amount of\nrestitution claimed and inability of the defense to then evaluate\nand contest the amounts claimed. In view of [Commonwealth]\nv. Gentry, 101 A.3d 813 (Pa. Super. 2014)[,] and\n[Commonwealth] v. Mariani, 869 A.2d 484 (Pa. Super.\n2005)[,] this was error at least [as] to the restitution claims of the\nvictims. A restitution hearing was originally scheduled for May\n14[, 2019], but was continued to June 11, at the request of the\nCommonwealth. Upon realizing its error, it was the intention of\nthis court to vacate the original sentence and deal with the\nrestitution claims before entering an appropriate final sentencing\norder. In the meantime, the defense appealed the original\nsentence on other grounds on May 11, 2019, such that this court\ncould no longer correct the situation.\nSupplemental 1925(a) Opinion, 9/11/19, at 1.\nAs the above-referenced statement indicates, the court conflated\nrestitution, fines, and costs of prosecution, delayed a hearing resolving each\n____________________________________________\n10 On April 17, 2019, the court ordered a hearing on \u201crestitution, fines and\ncosts\u201d to be held on May 14, 2019. Trial Court Order, 4/17/19, at 1.\n- 7 -J-S68026-19\nof these penalties until after sentencing, and was divested of jurisdiction\nbefore reaching a resolution. Id.; see also Commonwealth v. Klein, 781\nA.2d 1133, 1135 (Pa. 2001) (except in limited circumstances, filing notice of\nappeal divests trial court of jurisdiction). We appreciate the court bringing\nthis to our attention. We will, first, delineate among restitution, costs, and\nfines, and second, clarify the requirement that restitution be determined at\nsentencing.\nIn brief, the Crimes Code provides for restitution as a direct sentence,\nwhile portions of the Sentencing Code allow it as a condition of probation or\nintermediate punishment. Commononwealth v. Harriott, 919 A.2d 234,\n238 (Pa. Super. 2007); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(c)(8) (authorizing restitution as a\ncondition of probation); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763(b)(10) (authorizing restitution as\na condition attached to intermediate punishment); 204 Pa.Code \u00a7\n303.14(c)(2) (restitution may be imposed as a direct sentence or as a\ncondition of probation or intermediate punishment). Fines are also a\ncomponent of a defendant\u2019s sentence; costs, on the other hand, are always\nincidental to judgment. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721 (sentencing alternatives\ninclude fines); Commonwealth v. Soudani, 165 A.2d 709, 711 (Pa. Super.\n1960) (direction to pay costs in criminal proceeding not part of sentence).\nSection 1106 of the Crimes Code governs the imposition of restitution\nas a direct sentence, providing, in relevant part, as follows:\n(2) At the time of sentencing the court shall specify the amount\nand method of restitution. In determining the amount and\nmethod of restitution, the court:\n- 8 -J-S68026-19\n(i) Shall consider the extent of the injury suffered by\nthe victim, the victim\u2019s request for restitution as\npresented to the district attorney in accordance with\nparagraph (4) and such other matters as it deems\nappropriate.\n* * *\n(4) (i) It shall be the responsibility of the district attorneys of the\nrespective counties to make a recommendation to the court at or\nprior to the time of sentencing as to the amount of restitution to\nbe ordered. This recommendation shall be based upon\ninformation solicited by the district attorney and received from the\nvictim.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(c) (emphasis added). We note that under Pennsylvania\nlaw, \u201can order of restitution to be determined later is ipso facto illegal.\u201d\nMariani, supra at 487.\nSection 9721(a) of the Sentencing Code sets forth a trial court\u2019s\nsentencing alternatives; a fine is one of those alternatives. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n9721(a)(5). Fines may either be imposed as a defendant\u2019s sole sentence or\nas an additional sentence when the defendant has derived a pecuniary gain\nfrom the crime or the court opines that a fine is \u201cspecially adapted to\ndeterrence of the crime involved or to the correction of the defendant.\u201d 42\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(a), (b)(1)-(2). A court shall not sentence a defendant to pay\na fine unless the record demonstrates that: \u201c(1) the defendant is or will be\nable to pay fine; and (2) the fine will not prevent the defendant from making\nrestitution\u201d to the victim. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(c).\n- 9 -J-S68026-19\nIn addition to the sentencing alternatives under section 9721(a), the\nSentencing Code provides for mandatory restitution to the victim11 and\nmandatory payment of costs.12 Unlike restitution imposed under 42 Pa.C.S.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1106, 9721(c), and unlike fines, which are both part of a defendant\u2019s\nsentence, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(a), (b)(1)-(2), \u201ca direction to pay costs in a\ncriminal proceeding is not part of the sentence, but is an incident of the\njudgment. Costs do not form a part of the penalty imposed by the statutes\nproviding for the punishment of criminal offenses[.]\u201d Soudani, supra at 711.\nFurthermore, a court order is not required for a defendant to incur liability for\ncosts under section 9721. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(c.1). \u201cIn the event the\ncourt fails to issue an order for costs pursuant to section 9728, costs shall be\nimposed upon the defendant under this section.\u201d Id.

WALLACE,\nDefendant - Appellant.\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia, at\nWheeling. Frederick P. Stamp, Jr., Senior District Judge. (5:18-cr-00044-FPS-JPM-3)\nSubmitted: January 22, 2020 Decided: February 7, 2020\nBefore KING, AGEE, and RICHARDSON, Circuit Judges.\nAffirmed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nBarry P. Beck, POWER, BECK & MATZUREFF, Martinsburg, West Virginia, for\nAppellant. Robert Hugh McWilliams, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, OFFICE OF\nTHE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Wheeling, West Virginia, for Appellee.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM:\nCornell D. Wallace appeals his 77-month sentence imposed following his guilty\nplea to distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C)\n(2018). Counsel for Wallace has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S.\n738 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but questioning the\ndistrict court\u2019s drug weight calculation and the reasonableness of Wallace\u2019s sentence.\nAlthough notified of his right to do so, Wallace has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nWe review a defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cunder a deferential abuse-of-discretion\nstandard.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 41 (2007). Under this standard, a sentence\nis reviewed for both procedural and substantive reasonableness. Id. at 51. In determining\nprocedural reasonableness, we consider whether the district court properly calculated the\ndefendant\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range, gave the parties an opportunity to argue for an\nappropriate sentence, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2018) factors, and sufficiently\nexplained the selected sentence. Id. at 49-51. If a sentence is free of \u201csignificant procedural\nerror,\u201d then we review it for substantive reasonableness, \u201ctak[ing] into account the totality\nof the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 51.\nAnders counsel questions the propriety of the district court\u2019s drug weight finding,\nwhich we review for clear error, see United States v. Crawford, 734 F.3d 339, 342 (4th Cir.\n2013). Under this standard, we will not reverse unless we are \u201cleft with the definite and\nfirm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nWhen imposing sentence, a district court may \u201cconsider any relevant information before\n2it, including uncorroborated hearsay, provided that the information has sufficient indicia\nof reliability to support its accuracy.\u201d United States v. Mondragon, 860 F.3d 227, 233 (4th\nCir. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, the district court based its drug weight finding on hearsay statements from one\nof Wallace\u2019s codefendants, whom the court had sentenced previously. While the court\nlargely credited the allegation that, for several weeks or months, Wallace sold cocaine out\nof the codefendant\u2019s residence, the court substantially reduced the drug quantity attributed\nto Wallace to account for the difficulty in determining historical drug weight with great\nprecision. Based on our review of the record, we discern no clear error in the court\u2019s drug\nweight calculation.\nNext, Anders counsel generally questions the reasonableness of Wallace\u2019s sentence.\nHowever, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Wallace\u2019s Guidelines\nrange, afforded the parties an opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, and\nconsidered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at a downward variance sentence.\nFurthermore, nothing in the record rebuts the presumption of substantive reasonableness\naccorded Wallace\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence. See United States v. Louthian, 756 F.3d\n295, 306 (4th Cir. 2014).\nIn accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have\nfound no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wallace\u2019s criminal judgment.\nThis court requires that counsel inform Wallace, in writing, of the right to petition the\nSupreme Court of the United States for further review. If Wallace requests that a petition\nbe filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may\n3move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state\nthat a copy thereof was served on Wallace.\nWe dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\nadequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the\ndecisional process.\nAFFIRMED\n4",

No. 4-17-cr-00249-001)\nDistrict Judge: Hon. Matthew W. Brann\n______________\nSubmitted pursuant to Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a)\nFebruary 6, 2020\n______________\nBefore: SHWARTZ, SCIRICA, and COWEN, Circuit Judges.\n(Filed: February 7, 2020)\n______________\nOPINION*\n______________\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7,\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.SHWARTZ, Circuit Judge.\nJoseph Coleman was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Coleman appeals, arguing the District Court erred in\nadmitting a recording that was inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b).\nBecause the evidence was properly admitted, we will affirm.\nI\nLaw enforcement received information from a confidential informant (\u201cCI\u201d) that\nColeman sold firearms. The CI agreed to contact Coleman to purchase a gun. The CI\narranged the purchase with Coleman via text message. In one message, Coleman told the\nCI that he had \u201ca few joints,\u201d meaning firearms, for sale. App. 44. The pair\ncorresponded about the types of firearms and their prices, and they agreed to meet.\nBefore the meeting, law enforcement searched the CI to ensure he did not possess\nany contraband or firearms. The CI was then \u201coutfitted with a recording device,\u201d and he\ndrove to meet Coleman. App. 55. Their entire meeting was recorded.\nDuring the meeting, the CI and Coleman discussed several firearms that Coleman\ncould provide to the CI. The CI then purchased a 9-millimeter firearm from Coleman for\n$400. After the purchase, the CI placed the gun in the trunk of his car and drove\nColeman to a nearby convenience store to buy cigarettes. During the car ride, Coleman\ndescribed other guns he sold, as well as those he had in his possession. Coleman also\ndescribed various sexual encounters, spoke about women in a degrading manner, and\ntalked about territorial conflicts he had with others in the area. After their meeting, the\n2CI met the investigators, who retrieved the firearm from the trunk of the car. They also\nsearched the CI once more, again finding no contraband.\nA grand jury returned a one-count indictment, charging Coleman with possession\nof a firearm by a convicted felon. Coleman filed a motion in limine to exclude the\nportion of the recorded conversation that transpired after the sale of the firearm because it\ncaptured a discussion between Coleman and the CI about firearms sales and other\nactivities not included in the indictment. He argued that these discussions were irrelevant\nunder Rule 401, prejudicial under Rule 403, and inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The\nDistrict Court ruled in limine that the Government could play the recording for the jury\nup until the CI placed the gun in the trunk of the car, but not the remainder of the\nrecording because it contained prohibited \u201cother acts\u201d evidence under Rule 404(b) and\nwas unfairly prejudicial.\nThe Government played the limited recording at trial during the testimony of both\nthe officer handling the investigation and the CI. On cross-examination, Coleman\nchallenged the CI\u2019s credibility and asserted that the CI possessed the gun before meeting\nwith Coleman and lied about purchasing it from him. In short, Coleman sought to\ninsinuate that the CI had planted the gun on Coleman.\nWhen the CI\u2019s testimony was complete, the Government asked the District Court\nto reconsider its ruling precluding evidence of Coleman\u2019s statements about other firearms\nhe sold and had available for purchase. The Government asserted that, in light of\nColeman\u2019s apparent defense that the CI had fabricated the gun sale, the remainder of the\nrecording was admissible to show Coleman\u2019s intent to sell weapons, his motive for\n3meeting with the CI, and his general practice of selling firearms. Coleman confirmed his\ntheory of the case was that the CI \u201cbrought the gun\u201d with him to meet Coleman \u201cor [that]\none was handed to him\u201d by law enforcement on the way to the meeting, but argued that\nthis theory did not \u201copen the door\u201d to the previously precluded portion of the recording.\nApp. 176.\nThe District Court determined that it would \u201cmodify or change [its pretrial] ruling\u201d\nand \u201cpermit the Government to play the balance of the tape.\u201d App. 177. The Court\nexplained \u201cthat the probative value of the . . . tape now substantially outweigh[ed] any\ndanger of unfair prejudice against [Coleman].\u201d App. 177. The Court reasoned that it\nwould be \u201cappropriate now . . . to play the balance of the tape\u201d to \u201cdispel\u201d Coleman\u2019s\nargument that the CI \u201cbrought the firearm to the transaction.\u201d App. 174.\nThe Government called the officer handling the investigation back to the witness\nstand and played the remainder of the recording for the jury. During questioning, the\nofficer noted Coleman\u2019s references in the recording to having \u201cguns galore.\u201d App. 187;\nGovt. Ex. 5. This portion of the recording also included Coleman\u2019s statements about\nconflicts he had with others in the community and comments about his relationships with\nwomen, but no questions were asked about these topics.\nAfter the close of evidence, the District Court told the jury that it could consider\nthese portions of the recording \u201conly to decide whether Mr. Coleman had the state of\nmind, knowledge, or intent necessary to commit the crime charged in the indictment, or\nwhether Mr. Coleman had the motive or opportunity to commit the acts charged in the\nindictment,\u201d and \u201cnot [to] consider it for any other purpose.\u201d Trial Transcript Vol. III,\n4ECF No. 78 at 37. The Court further admonished the jury that it should \u201cnot consider\nany discussion of drugs, interactions with other individuals or possession of other\nfirearms as a substitute for proof that [Coleman] committed the crime charged, or that he\nhas a bad character or any propensity to commit crimes\u201d and should \u201cnot . . . conclude\nthat because [Coleman] may have committed other bad acts or crimes that he must have\ncommitted the crime charged in the indictment.\u201d Trial Transcript Vol. III, ECF No. 78 at\n37.\nThe jury found Coleman guilty and the District Court sentenced him to 120\nmonths\u2019 imprisonment. Coleman appeals.\nII1\nThe District Court correctly admitted the objected-to portion of Coleman\u2019s\nconversation with the CI under Rule 404(b). The evidence was offered for a non-\npropensity purpose, was relevant, and its probative value outweighed the danger of unfair\nprejudice.\nRule 404(b)(1) provides that \u201c[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not\nadmissible to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the\nperson acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1). \u201cOther act\u201d\n1 The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s evidentiary\nrulings for an abuse of discretion,\u201d United States v. Caldwell, 760 F.3d 267, 274 (3d Cir.\n2014); Marra v. Phila. Hous. Auth., 497 F.3d 286, 297 (3d Cir. 2007), but we exercise\n\u201cplenary review of whether evidence falls within the scope of Rule 404(b).\u201d United\nStates v. Green, 617 F.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted).\n5evidence, however, is admissible when offered for a proper purpose \u201csuch as proving\nmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or\nlack of accident.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2). If the other act evidence: (1) is \u201cproffered for\na non-propensity purpose;\u201d (2) is \u201crelevant to the non-propensity purpose;\u201d (3) has\nprobative value that outweighs \u201cits potential for causing unfair prejudice to the\ndefendant;\u201d and (4) is \u201caccompanied by a limiting instruction,\u201d United States v. Foster,\n891 F.3d 93, 107 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting United States v. Repak, 852 F.3d 230, 241 (3d\nCir. 2017)), then it is admissible. The objected-to portion of the recording satisfies these\nfour elements.\nFirst, Coleman\u2019s statements were admissible for a non-propensity purpose because\nthey showed proof of plan, motive, and access, and refuted a claim that the gun was\nplanted. See Foster, 891 F.3d at 108. Coleman was charged with possession of the 9-\nmillimeter firearm that he sold to the CI. The recording demonstrated that Coleman had\nregular access to various firearms and sold them for profit, which corroborated\nColeman\u2019s motive for meeting the CI. The recording also undercut the assertion that the\nCI was the source of the gun. See United States v. Lee, 612 F.3d 170, 187 n.19 (3d Cir.\n2010) (explaining, in a felon-in-possession case, that \u201cit is highly relevant to show that a\ndefendant had a motivation to commit the crime for which he is being charged\u201d). Thus,\nthe recording had an evidentiary purpose that did not bear upon Coleman\u2019s character or\nhis propensity to possess or sell firearms.\nSecond, the recording was relevant. Evidence is relevant if there is \u201ca relationship\nbetween the evidence and a material fact at issue[,] which must be demonstrated by\n6reasonable inferences that make a material fact more probable or less probable than it\nwould be without the evidence.\u201d Foster, 891 F.3d at 109 (quoting United States v.\nSampson, 980 F.2d 883, 888 (3d Cir. 1992)). The suggestion that the CI planted the gun\nmade relevant the evidence that Coleman had access to weapons. More specifically,\ndiscussions about other firearms Coleman sold and had available made more probable\nthat Coleman provided the 9-millimeter firearm to the CI, and made less probable that the\nCI planted the gun, which was the backbone of Coleman\u2019s defense. Therefore, the\nrecording was relevant to show motive, access, and intent to possess, and to rebut\nColeman\u2019s defense. Id. at 110 (\u201c[T]he [G]overnment was entitled to rebut\u201d the argument\nthat a gun was planted \u201cby presenting evidence of his motive for possessing a gun that\nday.\u201d).\nThird, the probative value of the evidence outweighed the risk of unfair prejudice,\nand thus \u201cmeet[s] Rule 403\u2019s balancing test.\u201d Id. at 109. Rule 403 requires balancing the\nprobative value of evidence offered against the danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the\nissues, or misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 403. We give substantial deference to\ndistrict courts in evaluating evidence under Rule 403. See, e.g., Foster, 891 F.3d at 110;\nUnited States v. Finley, 726 F.3d 483, 491 (3d Cir. 2013); Lee, 612 F.3d at 190.\nColeman\u2019s accusation that the CI, rather than Coleman, possessed the gun, made\nevidence that revealed Coleman\u2019s motive to possess and his access to guns \u201chighly\nprobative.\u201d Lee, 612 F.3d at 190 (concluding that evidence \u201creveal[ing] [the defendant\u2019s]\nmotive to possess weapons on the day in question, . . . is highly probative in a case like\nthis, in which the defendant has denied possession all together.\u201d). Though the recording\n7was prejudicial, as it evidenced Coleman\u2019s practice of selling firearms and engaging in\nactivities some may view unfavorably, the prejudice was not unfair.2 Coleman\u2019s defense\nplaced at issue whether the CI planted the gun. The objected-to portion of the recording\nrefuted that assertion, making this evidence of past sales highly probative and tipping the\nbalance in favor of admissibility under Rule 403.\nFinally, the District Court provided the jury with a limiting instruction, which\nmitigated the danger of unfair prejudice to Coleman. The Court told the jury that it\nshould only consider the recording \u201cto decide whether Mr. Coleman had the state of\nmind, knowledge, or intent necessary to commit the crime charged in the indictment, or\nwhether Mr. Coleman had the motive or opportunity to commit the acts charged in the\nindictment\u201d and not to \u201cconsider it for any other purpose.\u201d Trial Transcript Vol. III, ECF\nNo. 78 at 37. The Court further admonished the jury that it should \u201cnot consider any\ndiscussion of drugs, interactions with other individuals or possession of other firearms as\na substitute for proof that [Coleman] committed the crime charged, or that he has a bad\ncharacter or any propensity to commit crimes\u201d and should \u201cnot . . . conclude that because\n[Coleman] may have committed other bad acts or crimes that he must have committed the\ncrime charged in the indictment.\u201d Trial Transcript Vol. III, ECF No. 78 at 37.

Clarke,\nDefendant-Appellant. ) Judge, presiding.\n________________________________________________________________________\nJUSTICE BARBERIS delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Cates and Boie concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: We vacate defendant\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated unlawful use of a\nweapon but otherwise affirm where defendant failed to show that the circuit\ncourt committed plain error by considering his prior conviction at a\nsentencing hearing in an unrelated case.\n\u00b6 2 Following a jury trial, defendant, Lavar Pierce, was found guilty of one count of\nhome invasion (720 ILCS 5/19-6(a)(2) (West 2014)), a Class X felony, and one count of\naggravated battery (id. \u00a7 12-3.05(f)(1)), a Class 3 felony. Before sentencing, it was\nrevealed that defendant had a prior conviction in Alexander County for aggravated\nunlawful use of a weapon (AUUW), a Class 2 felony, based on section 24-1.6(a)(2),\n(a)(3)(A) of the Criminal Code of 2012 (Code) (720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(2), (a)(3)(A) (West\n12012))\u2014a facially unconstitutional statutory provision\u2014in case number 12-CF-39. After\nmerging the two counts, the circuit court of Alexander County sentenced defendant to 29\nyears\u2019 imprisonment for home invasion. Defendant appeals, arguing that (1) his prior\nAUUW conviction is void and (2) the court improperly considered the void conviction in\naggravation in imposing his sentence for home invasion. Defendant, therefore, requests\nthis court to vacate his prior AUUW conviction and remand for a new sentencing\nhearing. For the following reasons, we vacate defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction but\naffirm defendant\u2019s home invasion conviction and sentence.\n\u00b6 3 I. Background\n\u00b6 4 On July 14, 2015, defendant was charged by information with one count of home\ninvasion and one count of aggravated battery, both of which stemmed from an incident\nthat allegedly occurred on January 5, 2015. According to the information, defendant\nentered Jeremy Riggs\u2019 residence in Cairo, Illinois, knowing Riggs to be present, and\nintentionally caused injury to Riggs by stabbing him in the hand with a knife. Defendant\nobtained private counsel, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on April 26, 2016. The\nfollowing facts were taken from the evidence presented at the three-day trial.\n\u00b6 5 At trial, Riggs and his fianc\u00e9, Tiffany Bennett, testified to the following details\nand events surrounding the January 5, 2015, incident. Riggs and Bennett were at their\nshared residence when two or three masked intruders forcibly entered through the front\ndoor and demanded money. When Riggs resisted their demand and reached for his\npocketknife, one intruder began striking Riggs repeatedly in the head with a gun, while\nthe other intruders wrestled the knife away from Riggs. Both Bennett and Riggs\n2identified defendant as one of the intruders because Bennett grabbed his mask and\nexposed defendant\u2019s face during the struggle. In addition, Riggs and Bennett lived in the\nsame neighborhood as defendant and they had spoken with him on occasion. During the\nstruggle, Bennett was struck in the head and fled through the rear door to seek help from\na nearby relative. Riggs sustained a head laceration and his hand was nearly severed.\nRiggs momentarily \u201cblacked out\u201d and was later transported to a local hospital where he\nreceived staples in his head and underwent hand surgery.\n\u00b6 6 After the jury found defendant guilty of both counts, he obtained new counsel and\nfiled a motion for a new trial, alleging he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In\nthe months that followed, defense counsel reviewed the record, along with the transcripts,\nand amended the motion for a new trial two times to include additional claims to support\nhis ineffective assistance claim. The circuit court subsequently denied the motion and\npostponed the sentencing hearing, at defense counsel\u2019s request.\n\u00b6 7 On October 13, 2016, the circuit court conducted defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing.\nPrior to sentencing, the court addressed defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw filed that\nmorning. Defense counsel explained that defendant, after learning the possible sentencing\nrange, offered to provide the other intruders\u2019 names to the State in exchange for a lesser\nsentence, but the State rejected his offer. Although defense counsel advised defendant\nthat the State was not obligated to accept the offer, defendant did not understand and\nbegan harassing defense counsel with repeated phone calls. The State clarified that it had\noffered defendant a 25-year sentence.\n3\u00b6 8 The circuit court discussed the sentencing range with defendant and explained that\nthe State would request 30 years, not including the period of mandatory supervised\nrelease (MSR), if defendant chose to reject the 25-year offer and proceed to sentencing.\nIn doing so, the court noted that defendant had previously been sentenced \u201cto the Class 2\nfelony of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon.\u201d Additionally, in denying defense\ncounsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, the court found that \u201cbecause [defendant] find[s] his\nsituation unpleasant\u201d was not a valid reason to grant counsel\u2019s motion. The court also\nrefused to delay the sentencing hearing and reiterated that defendant\u2019s two options were\nto proceed to sentencing or enter a negotiated plea.\n\u00b6 9 Following a brief discussion with defendant, the circuit court proceeded to\nsentencing. After advising defendant of his appeal rights, the court stated that it had\nreviewed the presentence investigation report (PSI). The PSI revealed that defendant had\nthree juvenile adjudications for residential burglary, a 2008 conviction for receiving\nstolen property in Missouri, a 2010 conviction for unlawful use of a credit card in Illinois,\nand a 2011 conviction for distribution of less than five grams of marijuana in Missouri.\nThe PSI also revealed that defendant previously received a four-year prison sentence\nfollowed by MSR after a negotiated guilty plea to AUUW in case number 12-CF-39.\nNeither party submitted corrections or additions to the PSI, and defense counsel did not\nobject to the inclusion of defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction.\n\u00b6 10 While neither party presented evidence at the hearing, both parties presented\narguments regarding factors in aggravation and mitigation. Defense counsel argued that a\nlong prison sentence would create a great hardship on defendant\u2019s family because\n4defendant was employable and the father of a young child. Defense counsel also pointed\nout that the sentence sought by the State was greater than a customary sentence for a\nmurder conviction. Defense counsel requested that the circuit court impose concurrent\nsix-year sentences for the home invasion and aggravated battery charges.\n\u00b6 11 Before addressing the factors in aggravation, the State discussed defendant\u2019s\ncriminal history. First, the State noted that defendant had a prior juvenile conviction for\nresidential burglary, which demonstrated a pattern of defendant entering the residences of\nother individuals uninvited. Next, the State noted that defendant had a prior AUUW\nfelony conviction but explained that it did not use that conviction for impeachment\npurposes because of the Illinois Supreme Court\u2019s decision in People v. Aguilar, 2013 IL\n112116, which declared portions of the AUUW statute unconstitutional.\n\u00b6 12 The State recognized that a conviction under that statute was unconstitutional but\nnoted that our supreme court, in People v. McFadden, 2016 IL 117424, held that an\nunconstitutional prior conviction may still serve as proof of a predicate felony conviction\nif it had not yet been vacated. The State posited that McFadden stood for the proposition\nthat a court could still consider an unconstitutional conviction for sentencing purposes if\na defendant had not moved to vacate the conviction. The State claimed, however, that it\nmay be unnecessary for the court to resolve that issue because defendant\u2019s AUUW\nconviction \u201cmay be of no consequence\u201d in the court\u2019s sentencing judgment. The\nfollowing exchange took place between the court and counsel:\n\u201cMR. GOWIN [(STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY)]: And I say that\u2019s probably\ninconsequential because, Your Honor, you are familiar with this case. You\npresided over the trial. You heard the testimony of victims and you saw the victim,\n5specifically Mr. Riggs, display his injuries to the Court and to the jury and\ndescribe what he went through, and the pain he went through, and how severely\nhis hand was cut. He required staples in his head. He required surgery, wherein he\ntook a tendon or a ligament out of his ankle and put it in his hand and rebuilt his\nhand.\nAnd that leads me to the factors in aggravation for the statute\u2014\nMS. BURGER [(DEFENSE COUNSEL)]: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object\nto all of the foregoing that Mr. Gowin said because I believe those are all elements\nof the aggravated battery charge. I don\u2019t think they can be used as an\nenhancement.\nTHE COURT: I think that it is appropriate to consider the fact that there are\na number of elements that are inherent in the offense, that the General Assembly\nhas prescribed penalties for elements that are inherently in the offense, and I will\nmake the appropriate determination. However, you may make whatever argument\nyou think is appropriate.\u201d\n\u00b6 13 With regard to the factors in aggravation, the State argued that defendant had a\nhistory of criminal activity, and he was on MSR when he committed the home invasion.\nIn addition, the State noted that defendant committed the home invasion in an attempt to\nobtain money proceeds from illegal controlled substances sales and had attempted to\nconceal his identity by wearing a mask. The State clarified that it was not seeking an\nextended term but noted that defendant\u2019s crime \u201cwas accompanied by exceptionally\nbrutal or heinous behavior, indicative of wanton cruelty.\u201d Given the severity of the crime\nand resulting injuries, the State recommended that the circuit court impose a 30-year\nprison sentence for the home invasion and a consecutive 5-year sentence for the\naggravated battery charge.\n\u00b6 14 Before the circuit court imposed defendant\u2019s sentence, defendant asked the court\nto consider his family, in particular his young son, and that he was \u201cfound guilty for\n6something [he] did not even commit.\u201d The court stated that it had considered all of the\nstatutory factors in aggravation and mitigation but clarified that it had not considered the\ndefendant\u2019s continuing claim of innocence in rendering its decision. The court also stated\nthat it had considered \u201call of the facts and circumstances of [defendant\u2019s] case in the\ncontext of how the evidence unfolded at trial.\u201d In addition, the court stated the following:\n\u201cI think that the prior criminal history is a significant factor in aggravation,\nand I have considered all of the facts and circumstances of this case in the context\nof how the evidence unfolded at trial. The history that\u2019s before this Court suggests\na person who has a problem obeying Court orders.\u201d\nThe court noted several specific instances, including the termination of his probation in\n2010, a violation of his probation in 2011, and a subsequent \u201csentence of four years in the\nDepartment of Corrections, with a period of mandatory supervised release to follow.\u201d\nThe court merged the two convictions and sentenced defendant to 29 years\u2019\nimprisonment for home invasion. This appeal followed.\n\u00b6 15 II. Analysis\n\u00b6 16 Defendant first argues, and the State does not dispute, that his prior AUUW\nconviction is void and should be vacated because that conviction is based on a statute that\nis unconstitutional and void ab initio. A void judgment is subject to challenge \u201cat any\ntime, either directly or collaterally, and the challenge is not subject to forfeiture or other\nprocedural restraints.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) People v. Price, 2016 IL\n118613, \u00b6 30. A judgment of conviction will be deemed void if the judgment was based\non a statute that is facially unconstitutional and void ab initio. Id. \u00b6 31.\n7\u00b6 17 Here, defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction, entered following a negotiated guilty\nplea in 2013, was based on section 24-1.6(a)(2), (a)(3)(A) of the Code, a statutory\nprovision the Illinois Supreme Court had declared facially unconstitutional. See People v.\nMosley, 2015 IL 115872, \u00b6 61. As such, we agree that defendant\u2019s prior AUUW\nconviction, which was based on a facially unconstitutional statute, is void. See Price,\n2016 IL 118613, \u00b6 31. We note that a defendant may collaterally attack his\nconstitutionally invalid conviction on appeal and, if the constitutional infirmity is put in\nissue on appeal, a reviewing court \u201chas an independent duty to vacate the void judgment\nand may do so sua sponte.\u201d In re N.G., 2018 IL 121939, \u00b6 57. Thus, we vacate\ndefendant\u2019s prior conviction for AUUW based on section 24-1.6(a)(2), (a)(3)(A) in case\nnumber 12-CF-39.\n\u00b6 18 Defendant next argues that the case should be remanded for a new sentencing\nhearing because the circuit court improperly considered his void conviction as an\naggravating factor when imposing his sentence for home invasion. However, defendant\ndid not properly preserve this claim for review, as he failed to both contemporaneously\nobject and file a written postsentencing motion raising the issue. See People v. Hillier,\n237 Ill. 2d 539, 544 (2010); see also Ill. S. Ct. R. 605(a)(3)(C) (eff. Oct. 1, 2001) (\u201c[A]ny\nissue or claim of error regarding the sentence imposed or any aspect of the sentencing\nhearing not raised in the written motion shall be deemed waived.\u201d). We reject defendant\u2019s\nassertion that he has not waived review of this claim because the law changed after his\nsentencing hearing. Defendant acknowledges that, prior to his sentencing hearing, our\nsupreme court had declared the statute unconstitutional under which he was convicted of\n8AUUW (Mosley, 2015 IL 115872, \u00b6 61), and clarified that a void AUUW conviction may\nbe vacated by filing a proper pleading. McFadden, 2016 IL 117424, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. Thus,\ndefendant could have brought the issue before the court by moving to vacate his prior\nAUUW conviction prior to sentencing, objecting to the use of the conviction at the\nsentencing hearing, or including the issue in a postsentencing motion. Because defendant\nfailed to do so, his claim is forfeited unless he establishes plain error. Hillier, 237 Ill. 2d\nat 545.\n\u00b6 19 The plain-error rule permits a reviewing court to consider an unpreserved\nsentencing error when a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence at the\nsentencing hearing was closely balanced or that error was so egregious it denied a\ndefendant a fair sentencing hearing. People v. Reed, 2018 IL App (1st) 160609, \u00b6 56. A\ndefendant bears the burden of persuasion under the plain-error rule and, if the defendant\ndoes not meet his burden, the procedural default will be honored. Hillier, 237 Ill. 2d at\n545.\n\u00b6 20 In his reply brief, defendant asserts that the circuit court\u2019s consideration of his\nunconstitutional AUUW conviction in imposing his sentence affected his fundamental\nright to liberty and is reviewable under the second prong of the plain-error rule. In turn,\nthe State argues that defendant has failed to show plain error because the court imposed a\nsentence that was within the statutory range and was not primarily based on his prior\nAUUW conviction.\n\u00b6 21 As the State correctly notes, defendant was convicted of home invasion, which is a\nClass X felony with a sentencing range of 6 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. See 720 ILCS\n95/19-6(c) (West 2014). Because his 29-year sentence falls within the statutory range, it\nwill not be disturbed unless it is greatly at variance with the spirit and purpose of the law\nor is manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offense. See People v. Fern, 189 Ill.\n2d 48, 54 (1999).\n\u00b6 22 A circuit court is afforded broad discretionary powers in imposing a sentence, and\na court\u2019s sentencing decision should not be disturbed on appeal unless the court abused\nits discretion. People v. Stacey, 193 Ill. 2d 203, 209 (2000). A circuit court has wide\nlatitude in fashioning a sentence, so long as the court neither ignores relevant mitigating\nfactors nor considers improper factors in aggravation. People v. Flores, 404 Ill. App. 3d\n155, 157 (2010). Although there is a strong presumption that the circuit court employed\nproper legal reasoning in imposing its sentence and its sentencing decision is ordinarily\nreviewed with great deference (People v. Dowding, 388 Ill. App. 3d 936, 942-43 (2009)),\nthe question of whether a court relied on an improper factor in imposing a sentence is a\nquestion of law to be reviewed de novo. People v. Abdelhadi, 2012 IL App (2d) 111053,\n\u00b6 8.\n\u00b6 23 In considering a circuit court\u2019s sentencing decision, a reviewing court should not\nfocus on a few words or isolated statements made by the sentencing court but should,\ninstead, consider the entirety of the record. People v. Walker, 2012 IL App (1st) 083655,\n\u00b6 30. When confronted with a sentencing court\u2019s consideration of an improper factor, a\nreviewing court will remand for resentencing unless the record reveals that the weight\nplaced on the improperly considered aggravating factor was so insignificant that it did not\nlead to a greater sentence. People v. Heider, 231 Ill. 2d 1, 21-22 (2008). The burden is on\n10the defendant to affirmatively establish that the sentence was based on improper\nconsiderations. Dowding, 388 Ill. App. 3d at 942-43.\n\u00b6 24 Defendant contends that the present case is factually analogous to both People v.\nFischer, 100 Ill. App. 3d 195 (1981), and People v. Smith, 2016 IL App (2d) 130997, in\nwhich the First and Second District Appellate Courts remanded for resentencing based on\na circuit court\u2019s improper consideration of a void conviction based on a facially\nunconstitutional statute in aggravation. In Fischer, the defendant was convicted of a\nmarijuana offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment under a statute that was later\nfound unconstitutional. Fischer, 100 Ill. App. 3d at 199. When the defendant was later\nconvicted of voluntary manslaughter, the circuit court relied on the defendant\u2019s prior\nmarijuana conviction to enhance his sentence, stating that the conviction made him \u201c \u2018an\nappropriate candidate for the penitentiary\u2019 \u201d and was \u201c \u2018sufficient\u2019 \u201d to establish a crime\nwas committed or \u201c \u2018he wouldn\u2019t have been [in prison].\u2019 \u201d Id. at 199-200. The circuit\ncourt recognized that the statute had since been declared unconstitutional but found that\nthe constitutional infirmity had \u201c \u2018nothing to do with what went before.\u2019 \u201d Id. On review,\nthe First District reversed and remanded for resentencing, holding that the circuit court\nabused its discretion when it relied on the marijuana conviction in imposing its sentence.\nId.\n\u00b6 25 In Smith, 2016 IL App (2d) 130997, \u00b6 1, the defendant was convicted of AUUW\nunder section 24-1.6(a)(3)(A), a statutory provision later declared facially\nunconstitutional. When the defendant was later convicted of armed robbery with a\nfirearm, the circuit court relied on defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction when it imposed\n11a 20-year sentence. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The circuit court found that the defendant\u2019s criminal\nhistory was \u201c \u2018certainly a factor in aggravation\u2019 \u201d and, in reviewing his prior offenses,\nstated, \u201c \u2018[p]robably more significantly back in \u201903 when he was 23 years of age is his\nfirst weapons offense, [AUUW], for which the defendant in \u201903 was sentenced to four\nyears in [prison]. That is felony No. 3.\u2019 \u201d Id. \u00b6 9. The circuit court further noted that the\ndefendant\u2019s prior record and the nature of the felony convictions warranted a lengthy\nsentence. Id. On review, the Second District determined that the defendant\u2019s prior\nAUUW conviction was constitutionally invalid and that the circuit court erred when it\nrelied on the AUUW conviction at sentencing. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. After considering the circuit\ncourt\u2019s remarks at sentencing, the Second District could not conclude that the weight\nplaced on the conviction was so insignificant that it did not affect the sentence. Id. \u00b6 18.\nThus, the Second District affirmed the defendant\u2019s armed robbery conviction but vacated\nhis sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Id. \u00b6 29.\n\u00b6 26 We find the present case distinguishable from Fischer and Smith. Here, unlike\nFischer and Smith, defendant failed to preserve his claim for review and, thus, bears the\nburden of establishing plain error. Also, unlike Fischer and Smith, the circuit court, here,\ndid not specifically mention defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction in imposing its\nsentence but, instead, made a brief reference to \u201ca sentence of four years\u201d after finding\nthat defendant\u2019s history was suggestive of \u201ca person who has a problem obeying Court\norders.\u201d Accordingly, these cases, although instructive, are not determinative of the\noutcome in the instant case.\n12\u00b6 27 Here, even assuming the circuit court\u2019s remarks were sufficient to establish\nconsideration of an improper factor, defendant has failed to show that the court\u2019s\nconsideration of his prior AUUW conviction influenced the imposed sentence. At the\noutset of the sentencing hearing, the State advised the court that defendant\u2019s prior AUUW\nconviction was unconstitutional and provided the court with caselaw on the issue. Despite\nits assertion that the caselaw could be interpreted as allowing a court to consider an\nunconstitutional conviction for sentencing purposes, the State claimed that defendant\u2019s\nAUUW conviction was \u201cprobably inconsequential\u201d in light of the trial evidence that\nshowed the brutal nature of the home invasion and severity of Riggs\u2019 injuries. The trial\nevidence showed a very violent incident where defendant, along with other individuals,\ninvaded Riggs\u2019 residence wearing masks and attacked him with weapons, inflicting\nserious injuries to Riggs\u2019 head and nearly severing his hand. In imposing defendant\u2019s\nsentence, the circuit court stated that it considered the specific facts and circumstances of\nthe case in the context of the trial evidence. Thus, the record indicates that the court was\naware defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction was unconstitutional and that the imposed\nsentence was heavily influenced by the brutal nature of the home invasion.\n\u00b6 28 In addition, the circuit court stated that it considered all of the statutory factors in\naggravation and mitigation. While the court indicated that defendant\u2019s prior criminal\nhistory was a significant factor in aggravation, the court was aware that defendant\u2019s prior\nAUUW conviction was unconstitutional and did not specifically mention that conviction.\nDefendant\u2019s adult criminal history also included offenses for distribution of not more\nthan five grams of marijuana, unlawful use of a credit card, and receiving stolen property,\n13while his juvenile record included adjudications for three counts of residential burglary\nresulting in a commitment to the Department of Corrections. It appears the court only\nmentioned the AUUW conviction when it referenced a prior \u201csentence of four years\u201d in\nsupport of its finding that defendant\u2019s history was suggestive of \u201ca person who has a\nproblem obeying Court orders.\u201d However, the court also identified two additional\ninstances where defendant\u2019s probation had been terminated or violated. Thus, the record\nindicates that the imposed sentence was influenced by multiple offenses and probation\nviolations and was not dependent on defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction.\n\u00b6 29 After reviewing the record in its entirety, it is clear that the circuit court placed\nlittle to no weight on defendant\u2019s prior AUUW conviction in imposing his sentence. As a\nresult, defendant failed to demonstrate a fundamental error that was so serious he was\ndenied a fair sentencing hearing. Therefore, he has failed to establish plain error and we\nhonor his procedural default.\n\u00b6 30 III. Conclusion\n\u00b6 31 For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of conviction previously\nentered in case number 12-CF-39 but affirm the conviction and sentencing judgment\nentered in case number 15-CF-43.\n\u00b6 32 Affirmed in part and vacated in part.\n14",

    "text": "NOT PRECEDENTIAL\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n___________\nNo. 18-3660\nJOHN WILLARD FULLER\nv.\nCHRISTOPHER NARKIN; NICHOLAS DUMAS; SEAN FORSYTH\nChristopher Narkin,\nAppellant\n______________________________\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania\n(District Court No.: 2-16-cv-00995)\nDistrict Court Judge: Honorable Gerald A. McHugh\nSubmitted under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\non November 14, 2019\nBefore: JORDAN, SCIRICA and RENDELL, Circuit JudgesO P I N I O N*\nRENDELL, Circuit Judge:\nThis case concerns a high-speed police chase that ended with Appellant Police\nOfficer Christopher Narkin shooting and wounding Appellee John Fuller. Fuller sued\nNarkin under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for excessive use of force. Narkin appeals the District\nCourt\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss Fuller\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. For the following reason,\nwe will dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nI. Background\nOn October 16, 2014, Fuller led Officer Narkin on a high-speed chase through\nNorristown, Pennsylvania while driving a semi-trailer truck. The chase ended when\nFuller crashed into a guardrail and disabled the truck. Fuller alleges that after the crash,\nhe raised his arms in surrender and did not \u201cengage[] in any threatening behavior.\u201d A.\n26. According to Fuller, Narkin fired three shots after he had surrendered, one of which\nstruck him in the arm.\nFuller brought a \u00a7 1983 action against Narkin, alleging excessive force in violation\nof his rights under the Fourth Amendment. Narkin filed a motion to dismiss on qualified\nimmunity grounds, which the District Court denied.1 The District Court accepted Fuller\u2019s\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.\n1 Narkin also argued that Fuller\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was barred under Heck v. Humphrey,\nwhich requires dismissal of a plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim that \u201cnecessarily impl[ies] the\n2factual allegations, which state that \u201cwhatever threatening conduct [Fuller] might have\nengaged in, he had desisted at the time he was shot.\u201d A. 12. Accordingly, the District\nCourt denied Narkin qualified immunity because it is clearly established that an officer\nmay not use force on a suspect who has surrendered. This interlocutory appeal followed.\nII. Discussion\nAs a threshold matter, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear this\ninterlocutory appeal. Under the collateral order doctrine, we have jurisdiction over a\ndistrict court\u2019s order denying qualified immunity \u201conly to the extent that [the denial]\nturns on an issue of law.\u201d Dougherty v. Sch. Dist. Of Phila, 772 F.3d 979, 986 (3d Cir.\n2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We \u201cpossess jurisdiction to review\nwhether the set of facts identified by the district court is sufficient to establish a violation\nof a clearly established constitutional right,\u201d however \u201cwe lack jurisdiction to consider\nwhether the district court correctly identified the set of facts . . . .\u201d Bland v. City of\nNewark, 900 F.3d 77, 82\u201383 (3d Cir. 2018) (quoting Ziccardi v. City of Philadelphia, 288\nF.3d 57, 61 (3d Cir. 2002)).\nNarkin acknowledges the limits of our jurisdiction, but nonetheless urges us to\nrevisit the District Court\u2019s version of the facts. Narkin argues that the District Court\nerred in accepting the factual allegations in Fuller\u2019s complaint because there is \u201cno basis\nin any record of this case\u201d that Fuller had surrendered at the time he was shot. Appellant\ninvalidity of his conviction or sentence.\u201d 512 U.S. 477, 487 (1994). The District Court\nrejected this argument.\n3Br. 16. Narkin does not make a legal argument that he is entitled to qualified immunity\nunder the District Court\u2019s version of the facts. Instead, Narkin asks us to conduct an in-\ndepth review of the underlying criminal record to determine whether the District Court\nidentified the correct set of facts. Since this involves a question of fact, not of law, we\nlack jurisdiction over his interlocutory appeal.2\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the foregoing reason, we will dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n2 Narkin argues that we have jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s Heck ruling\nbecause it is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the issue of qualified immunity. Appellant\nBr. 14. Not only do we lack pendant appellate jurisdiction over the District Court\u2019s Heck\nruling, Narkin also fails to make any substantive argument on this issue, as required\nunder Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a).\n4",

Norton, District Judge. (9:19-cv-00284-DCN)\nSubmitted: January 30, 2020 Decided: February 10, 2020\nBefore AGEE, DIAZ, and QUATTLEBAUM, Circuit Judges.\nVacated and remanded by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nJohn Roosevelt Baccus, Appellant Pro Se.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM:\nSouth Carolina state prisoner John Baccus appeals the district court\u2019s order\ndismissing his petition for a writ of mandamus. The district court referred this case to a\nmagistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2018). The magistrate judge\nrecommended that Baccus\u2019 petition be summarily dismissed. The district court, noting that\nit had not received objections from Baccus, accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s\nrecommendations and dismissed Baccus\u2019 petition. Although we express no opinion\nregarding the merits of Baccus\u2019 suit, we vacate the dismissal and remand for further\nproceedings.\nOrdinarily, a litigant has 14 days to file objections to a report and recommendation.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1); Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(d),\nwhen a party must act within a specified time after being served, and service is made by\nmail, the party has an additional three days to act. If the deadline falls on a weekend or\nholiday, the period continues until the next business day. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(a)(1)(C). In\nthe case of an unrepresented prisoner, a submission is considered filed on the day the\nprisoner hands it to prison officials to mail to the court. Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266,\n276 (1988).\nThe magistrate judge entered his recommendation on May 30, 2019. Because\nBaccus received the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation by mail, he had 17 days from May\n30, 2019, to file objections. That deadline fell on June 16, 2019, a Sunday, extending the\nobjection period to the next business day, Monday, June 17, 2019. Baccus gave his\nobjections to prison officials for mailing on June 17. On June 20, 2019, before receiving\n2Baccus\u2019 objections, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and\ndismissed Baccus\u2019 petition, citing Baccus\u2019 failure to file objections.\nBecause Baccus\u2019 objections were timely filed under Houston v. Lack, the district\ncourt was obligated to conduct a de novo review of the portions of the recommendation to\nwhich Baccus objected. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b). And because the district court dismissed\nBaccus\u2019 petition before receiving his timely objections, we must vacate the district court\u2019s\njudgment and remand for consideration of Baccus\u2019 objections. See Orpiano v. Johnson,\n687 F.2d 44, 47-48 (4th Cir. 1982) (holding that failure to conduct de novo review of timely\nobjections is reversible error). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal\ncontentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would\nnot aid the decisional process.\nVACATED AND REMANDED\n3",

(dissenting).\nI disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s application for leave.\nBecause the Court of Appeals failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility,1 I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages\nand remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages\naward.2\nDefendant contracted with plaintiff to provide Information Technology work for\nGordon Food Service (GFS) from October 2012 through February 8, 2014 (referred to as\nthe \u201cfirst engagement\u201d). The contract included a noncompete agreement that expired on\nAugust 8, 2015. Defendant violated the noncompete agreement by soliciting work from\nGFS. Specifically, in June 2015, plaintiff contacted GFS so as to arrange additional work\nfor defendant, but it learned that defendant had already directly solicited and obtained\nemployment at GFS (referred to as the \u201csecond engagement\u201d).\n1 See MCR 2.613(C) and In re Miller, 433 Mich 331, 337 (1989).\n2 I agree with and would leave intact the portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion that\nconcludes the trial court erred by denying plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney fees as\ncontemplated by the noncompete agreement as part of the damages award.2\nPlaintiff sued and, following a bench trial, the trial court found that defendant had\nbreached the noncompete agreement and was liable to plaintiff for breach of contract.\nThe more difficult issue was determining damages. The Court of Appeals provided this\nsummary:\nDuring the first GFS engagement, GFS paid [plaintiff] $160 per hour of\nservices; [plaintiff] in turn paid [defendant] $115 an hour, leaving\n[plaintiff] with a profit of $45 per hour. After six months, GFS increased\nthe pay rate to $180 per hour. [Plaintiff] paid [defendant] $130 an hour, for\na profit of $50 per hour. Under both pay rates, [plaintiff] retained 28% of\nthe GFS payment. During the second GFS engagement, [defendant]\nworked for a different GFS department. Under this contract, GFS paid\n[defendant] $150 per hour. And from June 2015 through the time of trial,\n[defendant] had worked a total of 2,896 hours.[3]\nThe Court of Appeals also summarized the disagreement about damages related to\ndefendant\u2019s work during the second GFS engagement:\n[Plaintiff] provided evidence that it bore some overhead from negotiating\nthe first contract between GFS and [defendant], but asserted that with the\ninitial work under its belt, these costs would not be duplicated in a second\nplacement between GFS and [defendant] . . . . Accordingly, [plaintiff]\nasserted, its share of the payments during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS\nengagement would have been \u201cpure profit.\u201d Overall, [plaintiff] sought\n$180,800 in damages.[4]\nThe trial court \u201ctook judicial notice that [plaintiff]\u2019s overall profit margin was\n12.5% and determined to award [plaintiff] only 12.5% of the payments [plaintiff] would\nhave retained during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement, a total of $22,600.\u201d5 The\ntrial court ruled that \u201cthis [c]ourt\u2019s measure of damages is the . . . profit margin that\n[plaintiff] would have made on [defendant]\u2019s job starting on June 8th of . . . 2015 and\ncontinuing through the four months, through May 25th of 2017 . . . .\u201d\nThe Court of Appeals vacated the $22,600 damages portion of the trial court\njudgment and instead remanded the case for entry of a judgment awarding plaintiff\n$147,588 in damages for lost profits. This is how the panel arrived at that figure:\n3 Resource Point LLC v Addolux LLC, unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of\nAppeals, issued September 20, 2018 (Docket No. 338338), p 2.\n4 Id.\n5 Id.3\nAs noted, the parties\u2019 noncompete agreement provided that\n[defendant] was required \u201cto indemnify and hold harmless\u201d [plaintiff] \u201cfor\nany and all loss, costs, and other liability incurred or threatened\u201d as a result\nof [defendant]\u2019s breach. To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was\nrequired to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second\nGFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial,\n[defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours\nper week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s\nwork would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under\nthe second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16\nweeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and\nadding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of\n3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours\nof work.\nThe value of the hours then becomes critical to determining\n[plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that GFS paid $150\nper hour under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying the total number\nof hours worked (3,514) by this hourly rate amounts to a total of\n$527,100\u2014i.e., the total value of the second GFS engagement was\n$527,100.\n[Plaintiff] would not have been entitled to the entire $527,100, as it\nwould have been required to turn a portion of this amount over to\n[defendant] as his compensation. Accordingly, the trial court was next\nrequired to calculate how much of the total contract value would have\nflowed into [plaintiff]\u2019s pockets. To arrive at this figure, it is appropriate to\nconsider past dealings between the parties involved. As noted, the\nundisputed evidence shows that [plaintiff] retained 28% of GFS\u2019s payment\nduring [defendant]\u2019s first GFS engagement. The evidence of these previous\ndealings allowed [plaintiff] to prove its damages with reasonable certainty.\nHealth Call of Detroit [v Atrium Home & Health Care Servs, Inc, 268 Mich\nApp 83, 96 (2005)]. The proper measure of damages was 28% of the value4\nof the contract for the second GFS engagement; 28% of $527,100 amounts\nto a total of $147,588 in lost profits.[6]\nIn my view, the discrepancy between the trial court and the Court of Appeals is\nattributable to determination of overhead. Plaintiff maintained there would was no\noverhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100%\nprofit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly\nrejected the testimony that supported this contention. Specifically, the court found that\nRita Mehta, plaintiff\u2019s vice president, was not credible. It is within the purview of the\ntrier of fact to determine credibility, and great deference is given to the fact-finder on that\nissue. Having found Mehta not credible, the trial court calculated damages by applying\nplaintiff\u2019s 2015 profit margin to the gross income it claimed it would have received from\nthe second GFS engagement. The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for\nthe net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable.\nThe Court of Appeals improperly failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility. I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages\nand remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages\naward.\nMARKMAN, J., joins the statement of ZAHRA, J.\n6 Resource Point LLC, unpub op at 4.\nI, Larry S.

The plaintiffs filed a complaint with the trial court\n1alleging that the defendant was violating Columbia Municipal Code (Code or Columbia\nCode) \u00a7 17.26.020 (amended Mar. 20, 2006) and creating a nuisance. The plaintiffs filed\na motion for partial summary judgment for the counts relating to violations of the Code,\nwhich the court granted. The court\u2019s order permanently enjoined the defendant from\nserving food or drink outside, providing ancillary entertainment outside, or providing\nancillary entertainment inside without a special use permit as prescribed in the Code. See\nid. The defendant appeals.\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 C-1 zoning permits the operation of restaurants, tea rooms, and cafes in that zone;\nhowever, C-2 zoning is necessary to operate a lounge, tavern, or pub under the Code.\nColumbia Municipal Code \u00a7\u00a7 17.26.020(A)(14) (amended Mar. 20, 2006);\n17.28.010(A)(49) (amended May 16, 2012). A restaurant is defined as a\n\u201cbusiness establishment whose principal business is the selling of unpackaged food to the\ncustomer in a ready-to-consume state, in individual servings, or\nin nondisposable containers, and where the customer consumes these foods while seated\nat tables or counters located within the building.\u201d Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.04.030\n(amended May 16, 2012). The purpose of C-1 zoning, according to the Code, is to\n\u201cprovide for certain limited sales and service facilities located in residential areas to\nprovide a convenience to residents of the immediate neighborhood. Such districts are\nlimited in size and facilities to preserve and protect the general character of the residential\nareas surrounding such districts.\u201d Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.26.010 (eff. 1989).\nOne of the conditions of use for C-1 zoning provided in the Code is that \u201c[t]he sale of\n2foodstuffs or articles intended for human consumption on premises shall be conducted\nwholly within an enclosed building.\u201d Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.26.030(B) (eff.\n1989).\n\u00b6 5 On November 27, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the circuit court of\nMonroe County seeking a permanent injunction and damages against the defendant. The\ncomplaint alleged, in pertinent part, three Code violations by the defendant. They alleged\nthat the property on which the defendant\u2019s business operated was located in Monroe\nCounty; that until June 17, 2013, the property was zoned \u201cS-1 Historic Building District\u201d;\nthat the property was then rezoned to \u201cR-3 One Family Dwelling\u201d; that on December 1,\n2014, the city again rezoned the property to \u201cC-1 Neighborhood Business\u201d with an \u201cHP\nHistoric Protection Overlay\u201d; that the property continues to be zoned as C-1 with HP\nOverlay; that on June 18, 2015, the defendant purchased the property; that on May 23,\n2018, the city issued the defendant a business license to \u201coperate as a restaurant\u201d; on May\n21, 2018, the city issued the defendant a liquor license; on June 15, 2018, the defendant\nhosted a grand opening and continues to operate its business; and that the defendant has\nviolated and continues to violate numerous city ordinances including impermissible use\nas a lounge, impermissible sale of food and drink outside, and impermissible ancillary\nentertainment. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant \u201croutinely sells and serves food\nand drinks to customers outside its building.\u201d The defendant serves alcohol to its\ncustomers outside, does not require its customers to purchase a meal in order to be served\nalcohol, provides outside ancillary entertainment, provides indoor ancillary entertainment\nwithout a special use permit, plays both live and recorded music through amplifiers, and\n3does not cater to or provide any convenience to nearby residents as enumerated in the\npurpose section of the Code.1\n\u00b6 6 On February 27, 2019, upon order of the trial court, the plaintiffs filed an amended\ncomplaint that was substantively the same as the original complaint. On March 13, 2019,\nthe defendant filed an answer admitting that the defendant\u2019s property is zoned as C-1\nwith an HP Overlay; that it held a grand opening on June 15, 2018; that it has, on\nmultiple occasions, permitted its customers to consume food outside of the building; that,\non multiple occasions, it has permitted its customers to consume drinks outside of the\nbuilding; and that according to its owners, they \u201cwanted to go slow on the food\u201d because\nthey \u201cdon\u2019t have a food background\u201d and instead \u201cfocus on the view, the spirits, and the\npeople, especially since [they] have never been in the restaurant business.\u201d Therefore,\nthey \u201cfocus[ed] on making sure [they had] a good beer selection and good wine\nselection.\u201d\n\u00b6 7 On April 21, 2019, five of the plaintiffs filed a complaint against the defendant\nwith the Local Liquor Control Commission (Commission). The complaint sought the\nrevocation of the defendant\u2019s liquor license.\n\u00b6 8 On June 18, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment as to\nthe three allegations that the defendant (1) sold food and drink outside, (2) provided\nancillary entertainment outside, and (3) provided ancillary entertainment inside without a\nspecial use permit. It laid out the following facts relevant to the Code violations which\nprovided the following in relevant part. Over 80% of the defendant\u2019s sales were of\n1There were other allegations included in count I that are not the subject of this appeal.\n4alcoholic beverages. Less than 20% of its revenue came from the sale of food. Prior to\nthe filing of the complaint, the defendant\u2019s Facebook page referred to the establishment\nas a \u201cbar.\u201d The defendant permits its customers to consume food and drink outside. The\ndefendant does not require that patrons purchase food in order to be served alcohol. The\ndefendant has hired musicians to play music through amplifiers both inside and outside of\nthe establishment. On May 4, 2019, the defendant hosted a Kentucky Derby themed\nparty which utilized large outdoor projection screens to display the races. On May 15,\n2019, the defendant hosted a St. Louis Blues watch party where not only could the game\nbe heard outside, but the patrons were yelling and screaming during the game. The\ndefendant has, on multiple occasions, hosted \u201cXtreme Bar Bingo\u201d events where a\nmicrophone and amplification system were utilized to announce the game and made the\nhappenings of the event audible outside of the building. Lastly, the defendant submitted\nbut was denied a zoning amendment that would rezone the property to C-2 status.\nAttached to the motion, in relevant part, were sworn affidavits from all five plaintiffs, an\nannual sales report with food and beverage sale breakdowns, the defendant\u2019s responses to\nthe request to admit, the request for zoning amendment filed after the commencement of\nthe action, and minutes from a city council meeting that occurred on April 1, 2019.\n\u00b6 9 The defendant\u2019s response did not dispute any of the facts outlined by the plaintiffs\nin the motion for partial summary judgment. Attached to the response was the\ndefendant\u2019s business license and minutes from a city council meeting dated February 19,\n2019. The defendant did not attach any other contradicting evidence.\n5\u00b6 10 The trial court held a hearing on the motion, during which the court specifically\nstated that it was only dealing with those issues that would be outside the purview of the\ncomplaint filed with the Commission. It also noted that the remedy resulting from the\nCommission\u2019s decision would be different than the remedy the court could impose.\nParticularly, the court noted that its ruling was based on the language of the zoning\nordinance for a C-1 zoned district. Also, the court clarified that providing full waitress\nservice outside constituted the sale of food or drink outside. In reference to this issue, the\nfollowing colloquy occurred:\n\u201cTHE COURT: Well, here\u2019s the thing. You just said that your clients\ndon\u2019t serve food and beverage outside.\nMR. LYTLE: They don\u2019t sell it outside.\nTHE COURT: Well, that\u2019s semantics.\nMS. LORENZ: They take the cash and then\u2014\nTHE COURT: That\u2019s semantics.\nMS. LORENZ: \u2014and they put it in a drawer inside.\nTHE COURT: Right. I mean, they have waitress service outside.\nMS. LORENZ: Correct.\u201d\n\u00b6 11 On August 14, 2019, the trial court entered a written order granting the plaintiffs\u2019\nmotion enjoining the defendant from serving food or drink outside, providing ancillary\nentertainment outside, or providing ancillary entertainment inside without a special use\npermit.\n\u00b6 12 Thereafter, on August 19, 2019, the plaintiffs filed an emergency petition for rule\nto show cause as to why the defendant should not be held in contempt and motion for\nsanctions for continuing to violate the trial court\u2019s August 14 order. On August 21, 2019,\nthe court entered another written order clarifying its August 14 order. In its order, it\nclarified the following:\n6\u201cAt the hearing of August 14, 2019, Counsel for Plaintiffs and\nDefendant specifically addressed the issue of whether consumption of food\nand beverages outdoors at the Property is permissible under the Municipal\nCode of the City of Columbia (\u2018Code\u2019). This Court ruled that such activities\nare not permissible pursuant to the Code, as Defendant is currently zoned, and\nthe Court\u2019s Order of August 14, 2019 enjoins such activities.\nAt the hearing on August 14, 2019, Counsel for Plaintiffs and\nDefendant specifically addressed the issue of whether Defendant\u2019s activities,\nincluding the performance live music of any kind; the playing of programmed\nor recorded music of any kind; the playing of video of any kind, including\nwithout limitation live footage of sporting events, for viewing and/or listening;\nand the conducting of games and/or events such as \u2018Xtreme Bar Bingo,\u2019\nconstitute ancillary entertainment restricted by the Code. This Court ruled that\nsuch activities are ancillary entertainment restricted by the Code, as Defendant\nis currently zoned, and shall not occur outdoors at the Property, and require a\nspecial use permit to occur indoors at the Property.\nDuring the August 20, 2019 conference call, Defendant\u2019s counsel\nindicated his intent to file a Motion to Reconsider this Court\u2019s August 14,\n2019 Order, and requested the opportunity to present the Court with the City\nof Columbia\u2019s interpretation of the ordinances at issue. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\nobjected to the introduction of any such additional evidence and/or materials\nin response to Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, given that the\nparties have fully briefed and argued said Motion, and the Court has made its\nruling. Although Defendant may submit a Motion to Reconsider for the\nCourt\u2019s consideration, the Court denies Defendant\u2019s request to submit\nadditional materials regarding the City of Columbia\u2019s interpretation of the\nordinances at issue, as this matter has been fully briefed and argued.\u201d\n\u00b6 13 After the August 21 order, the defendant filed a motion to reconsider arguing that\nnew evidence had come to light that the trial court should consider. Attached to the\nmotion was a letter written by Scott Dunakey, the director of community development for\nthe city of Columbia. The letter defined the terms of and expanded on the applicability of\nthe Code that was interpreted by the court in the August 14 and August 21 orders. The\ndefendant also attached the complaint for the Code violation that five of the plaintiffs in\nthis matter filed with the Commission.\n7\u00b6 14 On September 3, 2019, the trial court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to\nreconsider. The defendant argued that the letter written by Scott Dunakey constituted an\nadministrative interpretation of the ordinance and should therefore be given deference.\nDuring argument, the defendant acknowledged that any proceeding held in front of the\nCommission could result in a restriction, suspension, or modification of the defendant\u2019s\nliquor license, a remedy outside the purview of the court. After hearing argument, the\ncourt noted that the defendant\u2019s response in opposition to the motion for partial summary\njudgment \u201chad no affidavits or depositions attached to it to establish a dispute in material\nfact.\u201d The court denied the motion to reconsider and, in making this decision, refused to\nconsider the letter from Dunakey attached to the defendant\u2019s motion. It then heard\nargument on the petition for rule to show cause why the defendant should not be held in\ncontempt and the motion for sanctions. The court found the defendant to be in contempt\nof its order and reserved its ruling on the motion for sanctions.\n\u00b6 15 The defendant filed a notice of appeal as to the August 14 and August 21 orders.\nFor the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\u00b6 16 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 17 As a preliminary matter, we note that the defendant has filed a motion to amend\nthe notice of appeal to include the September 3 order denying the motion to reconsider.\nOn November 20, 2019, this court issued an order directing that the motion be taken with\nthe case. Illinois Supreme Court Rule 303(b)(5) (eff. July 1, 2017) allows for the notice\nof appeal to be amended \u201con motion, in the reviewing court.\u201d The motion must be filed\n\u201cwithin 30 days after expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R.\n8303(d) (eff. July 1, 2017). Here, the motion to reconsider was denied by the trial court on\nSeptember 3, 2019. The notice of appeal was filed on September 13, 2019. The\ndefendant filed a motion seeking leave to amend the notice of appeal on October 7, 2019,\nwell within the deadline prescribed in Rule 303. Thus, the defendant\u2019s motion to amend\nthe notice of appeal is granted, and the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike those portions of the\ndefendant\u2019s brief referencing the September 3 order is likewise denied.\n\u00b6 18 The next issue we must address is whether the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their\nadministrative remedies when they filed their motion for partial summary judgment.\nSection 11-13-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-13-15 (West 2018)) vests\nin any owner or tenant located within 1200 feet of a property or building that is being\nmisused with the power to, in addition to other remedies, institute any appropriate action\nor proceeding: \u201c(1) to prevent the unlawful construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair,\nconversion, maintenance, or use; (2) to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure,\nor land; (3) to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about the premises;\nor (4) to restrain, correct, or abate the violation.\u201d In any action or proceeding for the\naforementioned purposes under this section, the court with jurisdiction thereof has the\npower and may in its discretion issue a permanent injunction. Id. The defendant argues\nthat the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the permanent injunction\nbecause the plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies with the\nCommission. We disagree.\n\u00b6 19 Here, the plaintiffs filed a complaint and subsequent motion for summary\njudgment as to the three counts alleging Columbia Code violations pursuant to procedure\n9prescribed in the Illinois Municipal Code. The motion for summary judgment listed the\nundisputed material facts and argued that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law because the facts established that the defendant had violated the Columbia\nCode. The court thereafter issued a permanent injunction.\n\u00b6 20 The equitable remedy available in filing a complaint for Columbia Code violations\nin the trial court, as prescribed by the Illinois Municipal Code, is a permanent injunction.\nThe administrative remedy available in filing a complaint with the Commission is\nrevocation or suspension of the licensee\u2019s liquor license, and possible fines. The\nCommission\u2019s authority to revoke a liquor license is separate from a court determining\nwhether an ordinance has been violated. The Commission has no authority to grant an\ninjunction, and as the trial court noted on the record, it does not have jurisdiction\nregarding revocation of a liquor license until a decision has been rendered by the liquor\ncontrol commissioner and all administrative remedies available in appealing that decision\nare exhausted. Here, the court explicitly excluded any issue relating to the defendant\u2019s\nliquor license. The court\u2019s order applied only to those counts related to the violation of\nthe Code by the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff did not need to exhaust all\nadministrative remedies related to the revocation of the defendant\u2019s liquor license before\nseeking an injunction enjoining the defendant from violating the Code.\n\u00b6 21 The defendant cites Todd v. Chaviano, 2019 IL App (5th) 170081, in arguing that\nthe plaintiffs were required to pursue the proceedings with the Commission before it filed\na complaint with the trial court. That case is not applicable to this situation as the court\nhere was not reviewing an administrative decision, like the court in Todd. Id. \u00b6 23.\n10Instead, the court here was issuing a decision independent and separate from any\nadministrative proceeding or remedy. The court was not reviewing the decision of an\nadministrative agency, but instead itself ordered a permanent injunction under its own\nauthority granted to it through the Illinois Municipal Code. See 65 ILCS 5/11-13-15\n(West 2018). Though it is true that after the filing of the complaint in the court, all but\none of the plaintiffs joined in filing an administrative complaint with the Commission,\nthat action has no effect on the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court on the issues\nrelating to the permanent injunction. We find that the trial court had jurisdiction over\nthose parts of the complaint that did not involve the defendant\u2019s liquor license.\nTherefore, the plaintiffs did not fail to exhaust their administrative remedies.\n\u00b6 22 Next, we move to the merits of the case and must examine the record to determine\nwhether there was a genuine issue of material fact in this case. Summary judgment is\nappropriate only where the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with\nthe affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Gilbert v. Sycamore\nMunicipal Hospital, 156 Ill. 2d 511, 517-18 (1993). In determining whether summary\njudgment is appropriate, the trial court must construe the pleadings, depositions,\nadmissions, and affidavits strictly against the movant and liberally in favor of the\nopponent. Id. at 518. \u201cA triable issue of fact exists where there is a dispute as to material\nfacts or where the material facts are undisputed but reasonable persons might draw\ndifferent inferences from those facts.\u201d In re Estate of Hoover, 155 Ill. 2d 402, 411\n(1993). Summary judgment is a drastic means of disposing of litigation and should be\n11granted only where the right to it is clear and free from doubt. Robinson v. Builders\nSupply & Lumber Co., 223 Ill. App. 3d 1007, 1013 (1991). We review a summary\njudgment ruling de novo. Pagano v. Occidental Chemical Corp., 257 Ill. App. 3d 905,\n909 (1994).\n\u00b6 23 Based on our review of the record, there appears to be no factual dispute. The\ndefendant admits to serving food and drink outside, to hosting Xtreme bar bingo, to\nhosting a St. Louis Blues watch party, to hosting a Kentucky Derby event, and to having\nlive bands perform outside. The facts upon which the trial court based its ruling are\nundisputed. Therefore, the next step in our analysis is determining whether the plaintiffs\nwere entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\u00b6 24 The plaintiffs are entitled to summary judgment only if the undisputed facts\nviolate the Code. In making this determination, we must decide whether the defendant\u2019s\nconduct violated the Code\u2019s prohibition against serving food or drink outside, providing\nancillary entertainment outside, or providing ancillary entertainment inside without a\nspecial use permit. As the defendant has already conceded that it provided ancillary\nentertainment outside in violation of the Code when it hired live musicians to perform\noutside, we will not discuss that violation. We will only address whether the defendant\nserved food or drink outside and whether the defendant provided ancillary entertainment\ninside without a special use permit.\n\u00b6 25 An issue involving statutory interpretation is a question of law subject\nto de novo review. Gibbs v. Madison County Sheriff\u2019s Department, 326 Ill. App. 3d 473,\n475 (2001). The primary goal of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to\n12the true intent of the legislature\u2014here, the city of Columbia. Id. at 476. The best\nevidence of legislative intent is the language of the statute itself. Id. \u201cWhen the language\nof a statute is clear and unambiguous, a court should not depart from the plain language\nof the statute by reading into it exceptions, limitations, or conditions that the legislature\ndid not express.\u201d Id. However, if the language of the statute allows for two\npossible interpretations, \u201cit should be given the interpretation that is reasonable and that\nwill not produce an absurd, unjust, or unreasonable result.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 26 The defendant argues that none of its aforementioned conduct violates the\nlanguage of the Code. Specifically, the defendant argues that its business license and\nliquor license make it exempt from the Code\u2019s use restrictions because the business\nlicense lists the defendant as a \u201cbusiness\u201d and there are no outside sale restrictions on its\nliquor license. This argument, however, is irrelevant. Any business operating in\nColumbia must not only abide by any licensing requirements but must also operate within\nthe limitations of its zoning requirements and restrictions.\n\u00b6 27 The defendant also argues that its actions do not violate the plain language of the\nCode. Here, the language of the Code provides that a condition of use under C-1 zoning\nis that \u201c[t]he sale of foodstuffs or articles intended for human consumption on premises\nshall be conducted wholly within an enclosed building.\u201d The language of the Code is\nclear and unambiguous. The defendant attempts to define the Code so narrowly that it\nclaims that the mere act of swiping a credit card indoors is enough to satisfy the\nrequirement in the Code that all food and drink must be sold inside the establishment.\nThis interpretation would result in absurdity and therefore is not a reasonable definition.\n13In support of its argument, the defendant relies heavily on the memorandum prepared by\nScott Dunakey, the director of community development. However, we agree with the\ntrial court that it would not have been proper to consider this memo because not only is it\nnot one of the types of evidence\u2014i.e., the pleadings, depositions, or affidavits\u2014that can\nbe attached to a motion for summary judgment, but the information contained in the\ndocument was not available to the defendant at the time it filed its response to the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We also note that should the legislative\ngoverning bodies of Columbia disagree with this court\u2019s interpretation of the language of\nit, they are free to amend the Code to reflect their intended definitions.\n\u00b6 28 However, even assuming arguendo that the defendant is correct that there is more\nthan one possible interpretation of this language, this court would not employ the\ndefendant\u2019s interpretation as that would lead to an absurd result wherein a restaurant\nzoned for C-1 purposes could flout all limitations imposed by the Code in relation to full\nservice of food and drink to customers outside the premises so long as a credit card was\nswiped or change was made inside the walls of the premises.\n\u00b6 29 Additionally, in support of this court\u2019s interpretation of the Code, section\n17.28.010 entitled \u201cPermitted uses and uses permitted by special use only permit\u201d lists\nthe permitted uses of buildings or land located in a C-2 district. Columbia Municipal\nCode \u00a7 17.28.010(A) (amended May 16, 2012). Notably, item 49 lists \u201clounges, taverns,\nand pubs\u201d as permitted uses of a building in a C-2 district; item 68 of that same list\nallows for \u201crestaurants, tea rooms and cafes ***.\u201d Id. \u00a7 17.28.010(A)(49), (68). The\nplain language of the statute indicates that these two items are independent from one\n14another and have different meanings. It is also important to note that the Code lists only\n16 permitted uses of a building or land in a C-1 zoning district and 86 permitted uses for\na C-2 zoning district. See Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.26.020(A) (amended Mar. 20,\n2006); Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.28.010(A) (amended May 16, 2012). It is clear\nfrom the Code that a C-1 district is a more limited district in terms of permitted uses than\na C-2.\n\u00b6 30 Accordingly, we find the defendant\u2019s interpretation unpersuasive and absurd.\nTherefore, in applying the plain language of the statute, we find that the defendant\u2019s\nconduct did in fact violate the restrictions of the Code where it served and allowed the\nconsumption of food and drink outside the walls of its building as this conduct constitutes\nthe \u201csale of foodstuffs or articles intended for human consumption\u201d outside of the\npremises.\n\u00b6 31 Applying the same analysis and reasoning as above, we similarly find that the\ndefendant provided ancillary entertainment inside its establishment without a special use\npermit when it hosted a Kentucky Derby viewing party, a Blues viewing party, and\nXtreme bar bingo. After our review of the statute, we find that the defendant has violated\nthe Code and that an injunction in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor enjoining the defendant from\nserving food and drink outside, providing ancillary entertainment outside, and providing\nancillary entertainment inside without a special use permit is appropriate.\n\u00b6 32 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 33 Therefore, we hereby affirm the circuit court of Monroe County in granting the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment.\n15\u00b6 34 Affirmed.\n16",

Docket No. 1:18-cr-00077-TCB-JSA-1\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\nversus\nLEONARDO KING,\nDefendant-Appellant.\n________________________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Georgia\n________________________\n(February 7, 2020)\nBefore WILSON, JILL PRYOR, and BRANCH, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:Case: 19-10251 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 2 of 5\nLeonardo King appeals the substantive reasonableness of his above-\nguideline 168-month total sentence for carjacking, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 2119(1) and 2, and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2. He argues that his sentence is\nsubstantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nWe review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-\ndiscretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). The party\nchallenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is\nunreasonable in light of the record, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the\nsubstantial deference afforded to sentencing courts. United States v. Rosales-\nBruno, 789 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2015).\nIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step\ninquiry, first ensuring that there was no significant procedural error, and then\nexamining whether the sentence was substantively reasonable. United States v.\nSarras, 575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir. 2009).\nWe evaluate substantive reasonableness by considering the totality of the\ncircumstances and whether the sentence achieves the sentencing purposes stated in\n\u00a7 3553(a). Id. The district court must impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not\ngreater than necessary, to comply with the purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a)(2),\nincluding the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the\n2Case: 19-10251 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 3 of 5\nlaw, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect\nthe public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2);\nUnited States v. Croteau, 819 F.3d 1293, 1309 (11th Cir. 2016). The district court\nmust also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and\ncharacteristics of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1).\nThe weight given to any specific \u00a7 3553(a) factor is committed to the sound\ndiscretion of the district court. United States v. Clay, 483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.\n2007). The district court is not required to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; an\nacknowledgement that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. United\nStates v. Turner, 474 F.3d 1265, 1281 (11th Cir. 2007). However, a district court\nabuses its discretion when it (1) fails to consider relevant factors that were due\nsignificant weight; (2) gives an improper or irrelevant factor significant weight; or\n(3) commits a clear error of judgment in considering the proper factors. United\nStates v. Irey, 612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc). The district court\ncan rely on factors already considered in calculating the guideline range when\nimposing a variance. See United States v. Amedeo, 487 F.3d 823, 833\u201334 (11th\nCir. 2007). \u201cA district court\u2019s unjustified reliance on a single \u00a7 3553(a) factor may\nbe a symptom of an unreasonable sentence,\u201d but does not mean that it is\n\u201cnecessarily unreasonable.\u201d United States v. Williams, 526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th\nCir. 2008) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n3Case: 19-10251 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 4 of 5\nWe will vacate a sentence only if we are left with the \u201cdefinite and firm\u201d\nconviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing\nthe \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that is outside the range of\nreasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. Irey, 612 F.3d at 1190. We\nmay not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable and\nmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors,\nas a whole, justify the extent of the variance. Rosales-Bruno, 789 F.3d at 1254\u201355.\nA sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a\nreasonable sentence. See United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th\nCir. 2008) (per curiam).\nHere, King fails to demonstrate that his 168-month total sentence is\nsubstantively unreasonable; we see no abuse of discretion. To start, King concedes\nthat the district court explained its reasoning for the sentence and the upward\nvariance in open court. Nevertheless, he argues that the sentence was unreasonable\nbecause the district court placed too much emphasis on the fact that he placed a\ngun to the victim\u2019s head, which made all other factors virtually irrelevant. Not so.\nContrary to King\u2019s assertion, the district court placed great emphasis on not just\none, but at least three factors: King\u2019s criminal history, the fact that he committed\nthe offense while on probation, and the fact that he put a firearm to the back of the\nvictim\u2019s head. See \u00a7 3553(a)(1). And the weight the court gave those three factors\n4Case: 19-10251 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 5 of 5\nwas within its sound discretion. See Clay, 483 F.3d at 743. Even if we agreed that\nthe district court relied primarily on the firearm-to-head factor, King fails to\nexplain why such reliance is unreasonable. See Williams, 526 F.3d at 1322. Also,\nat sentencing, King admitted that his co-defendant was less culpable than he, so his\nconclusory argument about sentencing disparity rings hollow. Further, the district\ncourt was entitled to rely on factors already considered in calculating the guideline\nrange when imposing a variance. See Amedeo, 487 F.3d at 833\u201334. Finally,\nthough King received a total sentence of 168 months, which was 21 months above\nthe total advisory guideline range, that sentence was still well below the statutory\nmaximum possible sentence of life, which indicates reasonableness. See Gonzalez,\n550 F.3d at 1324. Accordingly, we affirm King\u2019s sentence.\nAFFIRMED.\n5",

Docket No. 8:17-cr-00513-JDW-CPT-1\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\nversus\nREGINALD LEE BLACK,\nDefendant-Appellant.\n________________________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Florida\n________________________\n(February 7, 2020)\nBefore WILLIAM PRYOR, JILL PRYOR and MARCUS, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:\nReginald Black appeals from his convictions for conspiracy to commit credit\ncard fraud, credit card fraud, and aggravated identity theft. On appeal, Black argues\nthat the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained, inCase: 19-10793 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 2 of 6\npart, from a car he was borrowing during a public warrantless arrest. After thorough\nreview, we affirm.\nWe review the denial of a motion to suppress under a mixed standard,\nreviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its application of\nthe law to those facts de novo. United States v. Smith, 459 F.3d 1279, 1290 (11th\nCir. 2006). When considering a ruling on a motion to suppress, we construe all facts\nin the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. Id. at 1290.\nThe Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforcement from conducting\n\u201cunreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. IV. It also provides that\n\u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\nand particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\nseized.\u201d Id. A \u201csearch or seizure carried out on a suspect\u2019s premises without a\nwarrant is per se unreasonable\u201d unless justified by exigent circumstances. Coolidge\nv. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 474-75 (1971). However, the Fourth Amendment\npermits a warrantless arrest in a public place, without exigent circumstances, if law\nenforcement officers have probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred.\nFlorida v. White, 526 U.S. 559, 565 (1999); United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411,\n423-34 (1976).\nOfficers have probable cause to arrest when the facts and circumstances\nwithin their collective knowledge, or of which they have reasonably trustworthy\n2Case: 19-10793 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 3 of 6\ninformation, \u201care sufficient to cause a person of reasonable caution to believe that\nan offense has been or is being committed.\u201d United States v. Blasco, 702 F.2d 1315,\n1324 (11th Cir. 1983). A court may examine the collective knowledge of the officers\nif they \u201cmaintained at least a minimal level of communication during their\ninvestigation.\u201d United States v. Willis, 759 F.2d 1486, 1494 (11th Cir. 1985). In\nWatson, the Supreme Court noted that \u201c[l]aw enforcement officers may find it wise\nto seek arrest warrants where practicable to do so, and their judgments about\nprobable cause may be more readily accepted where backed by a warrant issued by\na magistrate . . . ,\u201d but it declined to turn a \u201cjudicial preference into a constitutional\nrule.\u201d 423 U.S. at 423.\nTo have standing to challenge a search or seizure under the Fourth\nAmendment, one must manifest an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe invaded area. United States v. Cooper, 133 F.3d 1394, 1398 (11th Cir. 1998).\nThe proponent of a motion to suppress has the burden to allege, and if the allegations\nare disputed, to prove, that his own Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the\nchallenged search or seizure. United States v. Bachner, 706 F.2d 1121, 1125 & n.5\n(11th Cir. 1983). A passenger in a private car, who has no possessory interest in the\nautomobile, does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the interior of the\nautomobile because he does not have the right to exclude others from the car. United\nStates v. Lee, 586 F.3d 859, 864 (11th Cir. 2009). Glove compartments, trunks, and\n3Case: 19-10793 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 4 of 6\nthe area under the seat are areas in which passengers would not normally have a\nlegitimate expectation of privacy. Id. at 865.\nHere, the district court did not err in denying Black\u2019s motion to suppress. For\nstarters, Black did not have standing to challenge the September 9, 2016, search of\nthe car he was borrowing, and, thus, could not have prevented the fraudulent credit\ncards within it from entering evidence. The record shows that, at most, Black was a\npassenger of the borrowed Infiniti; the Infiniti was registered in someone else\u2019s\nname, he did not pay to use it, and he could not exclude others from using it.\nAccordingly, Black did not have a possessory interest in the Infiniti, and, therefore,\ndid not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle\u2019s driver door\u2019s pocket\nwhere the fraudulent credit cards were found. Lee, 586 F.3d at 864-65. Moreover,\nbecause he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the borrowed car, his\ndiscussion of other case law is without merit.\nThe district court was also correct to deny Black\u2019s motion to suppress other\nevidence seized on September 9. As the record reveals, on September 3, 2016,\nOfficer Daniel Ford entered a \u201cprobable cause pickup order\u201d (\u201cPCP\u201d) for Black,\nbased on Officer Ford\u2019s claims that he saw Black driving on a suspended license and\nthat Black had fled to elude him after Black ran a stop sign and crashed a car. Six\ndays later, on September 9, Officers John Simpkins and Jason Lambeth arrested\nBlack while the PCP was still active after observing him exit from the borrowed\n4Case: 19-10793 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 5 of 6\nInfiniti in a parking lot. Black claims that his warrantless arrest on September 9,\n2016, pursuant to the PCP, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and,\nthus, any evidence obtained through that arrest should be suppressed.\nWe are unpersuaded by Black\u2019s claims, however, because Officers Simpkins\nand Lambeth effectuated a lawful warrantless arrest in a public place. As for Black\u2019s\nargument that Officers Simpkins and Lambeth should have obtained an arrest\nwarrant before arresting him because they had time to do so, the Supreme Court\nrejected this argument in Watson. See 423 U.S. at 423. As for Black\u2019s argument\nthat arresting him pursuant to a PCP was unreasonable, Black has overstated the role\nthe PCP had in his arrest. As the Supreme Court has made clear, the Fourth\nAmendment permits a warrantless arrest in a public place if law enforcement officers\nhave probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred. White, 526 U.S. at 565;\nWatson, 423 U.S. at 423-34. Further, where, as here, officers have \u201cmaintained at\nleast a minimal level of communication during their investigation,\u201d we may examine\nthe collective knowledge of law enforcement. See Willis, 759 F.2d at 1494. Based\non the collective knowledge the officers shared through the PCP, which served as a\ncommunication between Officer Ford and Officers Simpkins and Lambeth, it is\nindisputable that the latter two had probable cause to believe that Black had\ncommitted a felony and, thus, to lawfully arrest Black in a public place. The PCP\nwas not used as means to arrest Black within his home or take other action\n5Case: 19-10793 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 6 of 6\npermissible only through a warrant. See Coolidge, 403 U.S. at 474-75. Accordingly,\nwe affirm.\nAFFIRMED.\n6",

Considering\nthe need to avoid piecemeal litigation, judicial efficiency, the\nsystemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court\u2019s role as\nthe finder of fact, and whether delaying review would cause\nany party irreparable harm, the panel concluded that all four\nof these factors compelled dismissal of the creditor\u2019s\nappeals.\n* The Honorable Robert S. Lasnik, United States District Judge for\nthe Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.\n** This summary constitutes no part of the opinion of the court. It\nhas been prepared by court staff for the convenience of the reader.IN RE MARINO 3\nAffirming in part, the panel held that the BAP did not\nabuse its discretion in denying debtors\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s\nfees incurred before the BAP. Debtors were not entitled to\nfees on the ground of a frivolous appeal. They also were not\nentitled to attorney\u2019s fees under a provision in a deed of trust,\nand 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105 does not authorize an award of fees.\nCOUNSEL\nJonathan D. Fink (argued), Wright Finlay & Zak LLP,\nNewport Beach, California; Christopher Alan James Swift,\nWright Finlay & Zak LLP, Las Vegas, Nevada; for\nAppellant/Appellee.\nChristopher P. Burke (argued), Reno, Nevada; Christina L.\nHenry, Henry & DeGraaff PS, Seattle, Washington; for\nAppellees/Appellants.4 IN RE MARINO\nOPINION\nLASNIK, District Judge:\nAfter the bankruptcy court entered a chapter 7 discharge\ninjunction in June 2013, Debtors, Christopher and Valerie\nMarino, continued to receive letters and telephone calls from\nOcwen Loan Servicing LLC (\u201cOcwen\u201d) about the home they\nhad abandoned to foreclosure before filing for bankruptcy.\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing, the bankruptcy court\nfound Ocwen in contempt of the discharge injunction and\nimposed a $119,000 civil contempt sanction.\nOcwen appeals from that order, as well as from the\nbankruptcy court\u2019s order denying its motion for\nreconsideration. Ocwen also appeals from the Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel\u2019s (\u201cBAP\u201d) conclusion that it was \u201cerror for\nthe bankruptcy court to preclude itself from considering an\naward of punitive damages\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105(a).1 For\ntheir part, the Marinos appeal from the BAP\u2019s denial of their\nmotion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred on appeal.\nWe dismiss Ocwen\u2019s appeals for lack of jurisdiction and\naffirm the BAP\u2019s denial of the Marinos\u2019 motion for\nattorney\u2019s fees.\nI.\nThe Marinos purchased a home in Verdi, California, with\na loan that was later serviced by Ocwen. The Marinos fell\nbehind on their mortgage payments and decided to leave\ntheir home and allow Ocwen to foreclose on it. The Marinos\n1 Unless specified otherwise, all chapter and section references are\nto the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\u20131532, all \u201cRule\u201d references\nare to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.IN RE MARINO 5\nthen filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a discharge\ninjunction a few months later.\nDespite the discharge injunction, the Marinos continued\nto receive letters and telephone calls from Ocwen about their\nformer home. The Marinos presented evidence at a hearing\nshowing that they had received letters and calls from Ocwen,\ncausing them severe emotional distress.\nThe bankruptcy court concluded that Ocwen violated the\ndischarge injunction and imposed a civil contempt sanction\nof $1,000 for every violation, totaling $119,000. The\nbankruptcy court also concluded that it lacked the inherent\nauthority to award punitive damages for a violation of a\ndischarge injunction. Finally, the bankruptcy court denied\nOcwen\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\nThe BAP affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt and\nreconsideration orders but reversed and remanded on the\nissue of punitive damages. The BAP also denied the\nMarinos\u2019 motion for appellate attorney\u2019s fees.\nOcwen appeals from the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt\nand reconsideration orders. Ocwen also appeals from the\nBAP\u2019s decision reversing the bankruptcy court on the scope\nof its inherent authority to award punitive damages for a\ndischarge injunction violation. The Marinos appeal the\nBAP\u2019s decision on attorney\u2019s fees.\nII.\nA.\nUnder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1), our jurisdiction is limited\nto \u201cdecisions, judgments, orders, and decrees that are \u2018final\u2019\n[for] we have no authority . . . to consider interlocutory6 IN RE MARINO\norders and decrees.\u201d In re Gugliuzza, 852 F.3d 884, 891 (9th\nCir. 2017) (citing Conn. Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, 503 U.S.\n249, 252 (1992)). Because bankruptcy cases are often\ncomplex and litigated in various discrete proceedings, BAP\norders may be immediately appealed only if they \u201cfinally\ndispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.\u201d Id.\nat 892 (quoting Bullard v. Blue Hills Bank, 135 S. Ct. 1686,\n1692 (2015)). \u201cCorrect delineation of the dimensions of a\nbankruptcy \u2018proceeding is a matter of considerable\nimportance\u201d for \u201c[a]n erroneous identification of an\ninterlocutory as a final decision may yield an appeal over\nwhich the appellate forum lacks jurisdiction.\u201d Ritzen Grp.,\nInc. v. Jackson Masonry, LLC, 589 U.S. ___ (slip op. at 3)\n(2020). An order in a bankruptcy proceeding is final and\nthus appealable if it \u201calters the status quo and fixes the rights\nand obligations of the parties . . . [or] alters the legal\nrelationships among the parties.\u201d In re Gugliuzza, 852 F.3d\nat 893 (quoting Bullard, 135 S. Ct. at 1692, 1695).\nHowever, an order from the BAP is not final if it\n\u201cremands for factual determinations on a central issue[.]\u201d Id.\nat 895 (quoting In re Vylene Enters., 968 F.2d 887, 895 (9th\nCir. 1992)). We have departed from this rule only when the\nBAP remands for \u201cpurely mechanical or computational\ntask[s] such that the proceedings on remand are highly\nunlikely to generate a new appeal.\u201d In re Landmark Fence\nCo., Inc., 801 F.3d 1099, 1103 (9th Cir. 2015) (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting In re Saxman, 325 F.3d 1168, 1172 (9th\nCir. 2003)). We limit the exception to our general rule\nagainst exercising appellate jurisdiction when the BAP\nremands to the bankruptcy court for good reason. When the\nBAP \u201cremands a case to the bankruptcy court, \u2018the appellate\nprocess likely will be much shorter if we decline jurisdiction\nand await ultimate review on all the combined issues.\u2019\u201d In\nre Lakeshore Vill. Resort, Ltd., 81 F.3d 103, 106 (9th Cir.IN RE MARINO 7\n1996) (quoting In re Stanton, 766 F.2d 1283, 1287\u201388 (9th\nCir. 1985)).\nWe apply a four-part test to determine if we have\njurisdiction over an appeal from a BAP decision that\nremands to the bankruptcy court. We consider \u201c(1) the need\nto avoid piecemeal litigation; (2) judicial efficiency; (3) the\nsystemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court\u2019s role as\nthe finder of fact; and (4) whether delaying review would\ncause either party irreparable harm.\u201d In re Gugliuzza,\n852 F.3d at 894 (quoting In re Perl, 811 F.3d 1120, 1126\n(9th Cir. 2016)). We conclude that all four factors compel\ndismissal of Ocwen\u2019s appeals.\nAs to the first two factors, dismissal serves judicial\nefficiency and avoids piecemeal litigation by allowing the\nbankruptcy court to make additional findings of fact and\nconclusions of law before we exercise our jurisdiction. If we\nwere to resolve Ocwen\u2019s appeals now, the parties would\nalmost certainly climb back up the appellate ladder, asking\nus to consider the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision on punitive\ndamages. The Supreme Court has discouraged this type of\npiecemeal litigation for its inefficiency. See Bullard, 135\nS. Ct. at 1693 (explaining that the \u201crule of finality\u201d exists to\navoid \u201cclimb[s] up the appellate ladder and slide[s] down the\nchute\u201d and the \u201cdelays and inefficiencies\u201d that result).\nAs to the third factor, the BAP\u2019s decision expressly left\nopen the possibility for the bankruptcy court to engage in\nadditional fact-finding after remand. Although the BAP did\nnot \u201chold that the bankruptcy court must award a fine or\npunitive damages,\u201d it remanded the case for the bankruptcy\ncourt to \u201cconsider whether to do so.\u201d The BAP explained\nthat the bankruptcy court \u201cmight choose to issue proposed\nfindings and a recommended judgment on punitive damages\nto the district court or refer the matter to the district court for8 IN RE MARINO\ncriminal contempt proceedings.\u201d (emphasis added).\nDismissal preserves the bankruptcy court\u2019s fact-finding role\nwhere, as here, the BAP\u2019s decision remands to the\nbankruptcy court to determine whether punitive damages are\nappropriate.\nFinally, as to the fourth factor, other than protracted\nlitigation costs, neither party would be irreparably harmed if\nwe declined jurisdiction over Ocwen\u2019s appeals. Litigation\ncosts generally do not qualify as irreparable harm. Cf. In re\nExcel Innovations, Inc., 502 F.3d 1086, 1099 (9th Cir. 2007).\nIn short, the BAP remanded to the bankruptcy court for\nmore factual findings on punitive damages. The bankruptcy\ncourt\u2019s decision whether punitive damages are appropriate is\nnot a \u201cministerial task[.]\u201d In re Gugliuzza, 852 F.3d at 897\n(stating that \u201c[a] decision that remands a case for further\nfact-finding will rarely have this degree of finality, unless\nthe remand order is limited to ministerial tasks\u201d (citation\nomitted)).\nIn addition, the bankruptcy court\u2019s punitive damages\ncalculus was part of the same \u201cdiscrete proceeding\u201d in which\nthe bankruptcy court imposed sanctions against Ocwen for\nviolating the discharge injunction. Id. at 899 (quoting\nBullard, 135 S. Ct. at 1692). The BAP\u2019s decision did not\n\u201cterminate[] a procedural unit separate from the remaining\ncase\u201d or \u201cconclusively resolve[] the [Marinos\u2019] entitlement\nto the requested relief.\u201d Ritzen Grp., Inc., 589 U.S. at ___\n(slip op. at 6). The relevant \u201cprocedural unit\u201d in Ocwen\u2019s\nappeals is the contempt proceedings, in which the Marinos\nsought both monetary sanctions and punitive damages. The\nBAP remanded to the bankruptcy court to assess whether to\naward the Marinos punitive damages, relief that the Marinos\ndiligently pursued. This is therefore not a case in which the\nBAP\u2019s decision \u201cended the [contempt proceeding]IN RE MARINO 9\nadjudication and left nothing more for the Bankruptcy Court\nto do in that proceeding.\u201d Id. at ___ (slip op. at 12). We\ndismiss Ocwen\u2019s appeals for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\nB.\nThe Marinos appeal from the BAP\u2019s denial of their\nmotion for attorney\u2019s fees incurred defending against the\nappeal before the BAP. Unlike Ocwen\u2019s appeals, the\nMarinos\u2019 appeal only raises the frivolousness of Ocwen\u2019s\nappeal to the BAP, an issue that is both final and discrete.\nWe have jurisdiction over the Marinos\u2019 appeal and review it\nfor abuse of discretion. See Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v.\nParadise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 861\n(9th Cir. 2004) (citing Fischel v. Equitable Life Assurance\nSoc\u2019y of the U.S., 307 F.3d 997, 1005 (9th Cir. 2002)).\nThe Marinos point to three sources that they believe\nentitle them to attorney\u2019s fees: (1) Federal Rule of Appellate\nProcedure 38,2 (2) the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the deed\nof trust with Ocwen, and (3) section 105(a) of the\nBankruptcy Code. We address each purported basis for an\naward of attorney\u2019s fees in turn.\nFirst, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, we\nmay award damages and single or double costs to an appellee\nif we determine that an appeal is frivolous. See Fed. R. App.\nP. 38. \u201cAn appeal is frivolous if the results are obvious, or\nthe arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d Maisano\nv. United States, 908 F.2d 408, 411 (9th Cir. 1990) (per\n2 More precisely, the BAP may award just damages and single or\ndouble costs to an appellee as a sanction for a frivolous appeal from a\nbankruptcy court\u2019s judgment under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy\nProcedure 8020(a). The standard applied is the same as under Federal\nRule of Appellate Procedure 38.10 IN RE MARINO\ncuriam) (citing Wilcox v. C.I.R., 848 F.2d 1007, 1009 (9th\nCir. 1988)). The BAP did not clearly err in finding that the\nappeal was not frivolous and did not abuse its discretion by\ndeclining to sanction Ocwen under Rule 38. The Marinos\nare not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 38.\nSecond, the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the Marino\u2019s\ndeed of trust with Ocwen only allows Ocwen to receive\nattorney\u2019s fees for \u201ca legal proceeding that might\nsignificantly affect [its] interest in the Property and/or rights\nunder [the deed],\u201d including bankruptcy. That provision is\nreciprocal pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1717(a)\nwhen either party seeks to enforce or avoid enforcement of\nthe deed. See In re Penrod, 802 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.\n2015) (citations omitted).\nThe BAP did not err in concluding that the deed of trust\ndid not entitle the Marinos to appellate attorney\u2019s fees. The\nMarinos seek to enforce the discharge injunction, not the\ndeed of trust. Accordingly, we will not award fees under the\ndeed of trust.\nThird, and finally, the Marinos argue that they should be\nawarded attorney\u2019s fees under section 105(a) of the\nBankruptcy Code. But that would require us to overturn our\ndecision, In re Del Mission Ltd., 98 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir.\n1996), in which we held that section 105(a) does not\nauthorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees. See id. at 1153\u201354.\nWe cannot do so. See United States v. Belgarde, 300 F.3d\n1177, 1181 (9th Cir. 2002) (\u201c[A] panel not sitting en banc\nhas no authority to overturn Ninth Circuit precedent[.]\u201d).\nThe Marinos are not entitled to appellate attorney\u2019s fees\nunder section 105(a).IN RE MARINO 11\nIII.\nWe dismiss Ocwen\u2019s appeals for lack of appellate\njurisdiction.3 However, we have jurisdiction over the\nMarinos\u2019 appeal and affirm the BAP\u2019s conclusion that they\nwere not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees for their appeal to the\nBAP.\nAFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED FOR LACK OF\nJURISDICTION IN PART.\n3 The Marinos filed motions to strike and supplements to these\nmotions in each of Ocwen\u2019s pending appeals. Because we dismiss\nOcwen\u2019s appeals for lack of jurisdiction, we decline to reach the\nMarinos\u2019 motions to strike and deny them without prejudice.",

Phx. Mailers Union Local 752, 989 F.2d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.\n1993); see also Sw. Reg\u2019l Council of Carpenters v. Drywall Dynamics, Inc., 823\nF.3d 524, 530 (9th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 829 (2017). Our narrow\n\u201ctask is to determine whether the arbitrator interpreted the collective bargaining\nagreement, not whether he did so correctly.\u201d Haw. Teamsters & Allied Workers\nUnion, Local 996 v. United Parcel Serv., 241 F.3d 1177, 1178 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\u201c\u2018[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract\nand acting within the scope of his authority,\u2019 his award must be upheld.\u201d Drywall\nDynamics, 823 F.3d at 530 (quoting United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Misco,\nInc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987)).\nWe have recognized an exception to the \u201cnearly unparalleled degree of\ndeference\u201d afforded to labor arbitration awards by declining to enforce awards that\n\u201cdo[] not draw [their] essence from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d Id.\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). This exception does not \u201copen a\nback door to judicial review of the merits of an arbitral award.\u201d Haw. Teamsters,\n241 F.3d at 1183. Rather, it is \u201creserved for those egregious cases in which a court\n2determines that the arbitrator\u2019s award ignored the plain language of the contract,\u201d\nStead Motors of Walnut Creek v. Auto. Mach. Lodge No. 1173, 886 F.2d 1200,\n1205 n.6 (9th Cir. 1989) (en banc), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 946 (1990). This is not\nsuch a case.\nThe district court correctly concluded that the arbitrator neither ignored the\nplain terms of the 2016\u201319 collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) nor otherwise\nexceeded his delegated authority.\nFirst, because no provision plainly prohibited or mandated above-scale\nwages, the arbitrator properly considered evidence extrinsic to the CBA, including\nGreif\u2019s thirteen-year practice of paying such wages to deserving employees. See\nEdward Hines Lumber Co. of Or. v. Lumber & Sawmill Workers Local No. 2588,\n764 F.2d 631, 633, 635 (9th Cir. 1985) (upholding an award that precluded the\ncompany from subcontracting more than 40% of its operations, notwithstanding a\nmanagement rights clause and the absence of an \u201cexpress provision regarding\nsubcontracting,\u201d where the arbitrator \u201cclearly based his decision in large part on\nthe employer\u2019s undisputed historical practice of maintaining a 60\u201340 ratio\u201d of\nbargaining unit employees to subcontractors). Based on this practice, which\npersisted under materially similar predecessor CBAs, the arbitrator concluded that\nthe above-scale wages were an implied term of the CBA. He reasonably declined\n3to infer an agreement to eliminate those rates from adjustments made to the wage\nscale in 2016, as those adjustments resulted from brief, friendly negotiations that\ndid not address above-scale wages. Cf. ASARCO LLC v. United Steel, Paper &\nForestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied Indus.& Serv. Workers Int'l Union, 910\nF.3d 485, 491\u201392 (9th Cir. 2018) (declining to vacate arbitration award requiring a\ncompany to pay bonuses to new hires where parties \u201cnever discussed or even\nacknowledged\u201d that an agreed-upon amendment to the contract\u2019s pension provision\nwould render new hires ineligible for bonuses).\nSecond, by restoring above-scale wages, the arbitrator merely reinstated an\nimplied contract term that Greif breached by unilaterally reducing the affected\nemployees\u2019 wages. He did not create a new wage scale, change the wage scale, or\notherwise modify the CBA\u2019s terms. Accordingly, he did not exceed his powers\nunder the CBA. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4); Oxford Health Plans LLC v. Sutter, 569\nU.S. 564, 569\u201370 (2013).\nIn short, the arbitrator \u201cengage[d] with the interpretive task\u201d by \u201clook[ing] at\nand constru[ing] the contract,\u201d and his decision was \u201cgrounded in [his] reading of\nthe parties\u2019 agreement\u201d as well as \u201cpast practices of the parties.\u201d Drywall\nDynamics, 823 F.3d at 532\u201333. The district court properly enforced the award.\nAFFIRMED.\n4",

(dissenting).\nI disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s application for leave.\nBecause the Court of Appeals failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility,1 I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages\nand remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages\naward.2\nDefendant contracted with plaintiff to provide Information Technology work for\nGordon Food Service (GFS) from October 2012 through February 8, 2014 (referred to as\nthe \u201cfirst engagement\u201d). The contract included a noncompete agreement that expired on\nAugust 8, 2015. Defendant violated the noncompete agreement by soliciting work from\nGFS. Specifically, in June 2015, plaintiff contacted GFS so as to arrange additional work\nfor defendant, but it learned that defendant had already directly solicited and obtained\nemployment at GFS (referred to as the \u201csecond engagement\u201d).\n1 See MCR 2.613(C) and In re Miller, 433 Mich 331, 337 (1989).\n2 I agree with and would leave intact the portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion that\nconcludes the trial court erred by denying plaintiff\u2019s request for attorney fees as\ncontemplated by the noncompete agreement as part of the damages award.2\nPlaintiff sued and, following a bench trial, the trial court found that defendant had\nbreached the noncompete agreement and was liable to plaintiff for breach of contract.\nThe more difficult issue was determining damages. The Court of Appeals provided this\nsummary:\nDuring the first GFS engagement, GFS paid [plaintiff] $160 per hour of\nservices; [plaintiff] in turn paid [defendant] $115 an hour, leaving\n[plaintiff] with a profit of $45 per hour. After six months, GFS increased\nthe pay rate to $180 per hour. [Plaintiff] paid [defendant] $130 an hour, for\na profit of $50 per hour. Under both pay rates, [plaintiff] retained 28% of\nthe GFS payment. During the second GFS engagement, [defendant]\nworked for a different GFS department. Under this contract, GFS paid\n[defendant] $150 per hour. And from June 2015 through the time of trial,\n[defendant] had worked a total of 2,896 hours.[3]\nThe Court of Appeals also summarized the disagreement about damages related to\ndefendant\u2019s work during the second GFS engagement:\n[Plaintiff] provided evidence that it bore some overhead from negotiating\nthe first contract between GFS and [defendant], but asserted that with the\ninitial work under its belt, these costs would not be duplicated in a second\nplacement between GFS and [defendant] . . . . Accordingly, [plaintiff]\nasserted, its share of the payments during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS\nengagement would have been \u201cpure profit.\u201d Overall, [plaintiff] sought\n$180,800 in damages.[4]\nThe trial court \u201ctook judicial notice that [plaintiff]\u2019s overall profit margin was\n12.5% and determined to award [plaintiff] only 12.5% of the payments [plaintiff] would\nhave retained during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement, a total of $22,600.\u201d5 The\ntrial court ruled that \u201cthis [c]ourt\u2019s measure of damages is the . . . profit margin that\n[plaintiff] would have made on [defendant]\u2019s job starting on June 8th of . . . 2015 and\ncontinuing through the four months, through May 25th of 2017 . . . .\u201d\nThe Court of Appeals vacated the $22,600 damages portion of the trial court\njudgment and instead remanded the case for entry of a judgment awarding plaintiff\n$147,588 in damages for lost profits. This is how the panel arrived at that figure:\n3 Resource Point LLC v Addolux LLC, unpublished per curiam opinion of the Court of\nAppeals, issued September 20, 2018 (Docket No. 338338), p 2.\n4 Id.\n5 Id.3\nAs noted, the parties\u2019 noncompete agreement provided that\n[defendant] was required \u201cto indemnify and hold harmless\u201d [plaintiff] \u201cfor\nany and all loss, costs, and other liability incurred or threatened\u201d as a result\nof [defendant]\u2019s breach. To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was\nrequired to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second\nGFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial,\n[defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours\nper week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s\nwork would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under\nthe second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16\nweeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and\nadding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of\n3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours\nof work.\nThe value of the hours then becomes critical to determining\n[plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that GFS paid $150\nper hour under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying the total number\nof hours worked (3,514) by this hourly rate amounts to a total of\n$527,100\u2014i.e., the total value of the second GFS engagement was\n$527,100.\n[Plaintiff] would not have been entitled to the entire $527,100, as it\nwould have been required to turn a portion of this amount over to\n[defendant] as his compensation. Accordingly, the trial court was next\nrequired to calculate how much of the total contract value would have\nflowed into [plaintiff]\u2019s pockets. To arrive at this figure, it is appropriate to\nconsider past dealings between the parties involved. As noted, the\nundisputed evidence shows that [plaintiff] retained 28% of GFS\u2019s payment\nduring [defendant]\u2019s first GFS engagement. The evidence of these previous\ndealings allowed [plaintiff] to prove its damages with reasonable certainty.\nHealth Call of Detroit [v Atrium Home & Health Care Servs, Inc, 268 Mich\nApp 83, 96 (2005)]. The proper measure of damages was 28% of the value4\nof the contract for the second GFS engagement; 28% of $527,100 amounts\nto a total of $147,588 in lost profits.[6]\nIn my view, the discrepancy between the trial court and the Court of Appeals is\nattributable to determination of overhead. Plaintiff maintained there would was no\noverhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100%\nprofit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly\nrejected the testimony that supported this contention. Specifically, the court found that\nRita Mehta, plaintiff\u2019s vice president, was not credible. It is within the purview of the\ntrier of fact to determine credibility, and great deference is given to the fact-finder on that\nissue. Having found Mehta not credible, the trial court calculated damages by applying\nplaintiff\u2019s 2015 profit margin to the gross income it claimed it would have received from\nthe second GFS engagement. The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for\nthe net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable.\nThe Court of Appeals improperly failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness\ncredibility. I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages\nand remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages\naward.\nMARKMAN, J., joins the statement of ZAHRA, J.\n6 Resource Point LLC, unpub op at 4.\nI, Larry S.

Lehrman, Clerk\nv. )\n) THIS IS AN UNPUBLISHED\nCHRISTOPHER ERIC GRIFFIN, JR., ) OPINION AND SHALL NOT\n) BE CITED AS AUTHORITY\nDefendant-Appellant. )\n)\nAppeal from the District Court of the Sixth Judicial District, State of Idaho,\nBannock County. Hon. Stephen S. Dunn, District Judge.\nJudgment of conviction, affirmed.\nEric D. Fredericksen, State Appellate Public Defender; Justin M. Curtis, Deputy\nAppellate Public Defender, Boise, for appellant.\nHon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Andrew W. Wake, Deputy\nAttorney General, Boise, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nGRATTON, Judge\nChristopher Eric Griffin, Jr. appeals from his judgment of conviction entered upon his\nconditional guilty plea to attempted arson. Griffin argues the district court erred in excluding\nproposed testimony regarding a defense of impossibility. For the reasons set forth below, we\naffirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nGriffin was charged with arson in the third degree and attempted arson in the third\ndegree. The charges arose after Griffin used a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d on the sidewalk outside the\nBannock County Courthouse. Surveillance video captured the act and a passerby reported a burn\nmark and charred glass on the sidewalk. The following day, Griffin admitted to filling a beer\nbottle with gas with the intent to do the same. A gas station employee saw Griffin with the open\n1container filled with gas and called the police. A magistrate subsequently found probable cause\nand the prosecutor filed an information charging arson in the third degree and attempted arson in\nthe third degree.\nPrior to trial, the State moved to exclude the testimony of Griffin\u2019s proposed expert\nwitness whose testimony would address the inability for concrete to burn. Griffin argued the\ntestimony was relevant because one cannot attempt to commit a crime that cannot be committed.\nThe district court granted the motion, determining impossibility is not a defense for an attempt\ncharge. Thereafter, the parties entered into a conditional plea agreement. Pursuant to the\nagreement, Griffin would plead guilty to one count of attempted arson in the third degree while\nthe remaining charge would be dismissed. Griffin reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s\ndetermination on the impossibility defense. Griffin\u2019s case proceeded to sentencing and the\ndistrict court sentenced Griffin to a unified term of five years with three years determinate. The\ndistrict court subsequently suspended the sentence and placed Griffin on probation for a period\nof four years. Griffin timely appeals.\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe trial court has broad discretion in the admission and exclusion of evidence and its\ndecision to admit evidence will be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of that\ndiscretion. State v. Folk, 162 Idaho 620, 625, 402 P.3d 1073, 1078 (2017).\nIII.\nANALYSIS\nGriffin argues the district court erred in excluding his proposed expert and any testimony\nregarding a defense of impossibility. Specifically, he asserts there cannot be an attempt to\ncommit a crime that cannot be committed. Based on this Court\u2019s precedent, the district court\nheld that factual or legal impossibility is irrelevant for purposes of Idaho\u2019s attempt statute.1 See\nState v. Glass, 139 Idaho 815, 818, 87 P.3d 302, 305 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Curtiss, 138 Idaho\n466, 467, 65 P.3d 207, 208 (Ct. App. 2002). Griffin argues that because cement is not\ncombustible it is impossible for him to have attempted to burn the sidewalk and therefore it is not\npossible for him to be guilty of attempted arson. The State asserts there is no impossibility\ndefense to an attempt charge and the evidence was properly excluded. The district court\n1 Idaho Code \u00a7 18-306.\n2correctly determined the same. Factual or legal impossibility is not relevant to a determination\nof the defendant\u2019s guilt of attempt. Glass, 139 Idaho at 818, 87 P.3d at 305. Griffin concedes as\nmuch in his briefing. Given this precedent and Griffin\u2019s lack of argument otherwise, we hold the\ndistrict court did not err in excluding Griffin\u2019s proposed expert witness.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence related to a defense\nof impossibility. Therefore, Griffin\u2019s judgment of conviction is affirmed.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge LORELLO CONCUR.\n3",

JAMES CHRISTOPHER WALKER\nCOURT FROM WHICH APPEALED: MADISON COUNTY CHANCERY COURT\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT: JOHN R. REEVES\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE: KIMBERLY DAVIS McCORMACK\nNATURE OF THE CASE: CIVIL - DOMESTIC RELATIONS\nDISPOSITION: AFFIRMED - 02/11/2020\nMOTION FOR REHEARING FILED:\nMANDATE ISSUED:\nBEFORE BARNES, C.J., WESTBROOKS AND McCARTY, JJ.\nMcCARTY, J., FOR THE COURT:\n\u00b61. Kimberly Oliver and Charles Best, Jr. were granted an irreconcilable-differences\ndivorce, and Kimberly was granted sole physical custody of their child and child support.\nYears later, she sought an increase in child support. The chancery court increased Charles\u2019\nmonthly support obligation. Aggrieved, Charles appeals.\nFACTS\n\u00b62. Kimberly and Charles were married and had one child\u2014K.O.B.1 During their divorce\nproceedings, the pair agreed to joint legal custody of K.O.B., with Kimberly retaining sole\nphysical custody. They also agreed Charles would pay $830 per month in child support.\n1 We use initials to protect the privacy of the minor child involved in this matter.Kimberly was later granted sole legal and physical custody, with Charles being awarded\nvisitation rights and obligated to pay child support.\n\u00b63. At the time of the divorce, Kimberly and K.O.B. lived in a converted barn at the\nformer marital residence. While there, Kimberly was free of mortgage, rent, and utility\nexpenses. Kimberly subsequently remarried and moved to Virginia, where she is now\nresponsible for monthly mortgage and utility payments.\n\u00b64. Kimberly filed a motion with the chancery court, seeking additional support to\nsupplement the growing expenses associated with raising a teenage daughter. Kimberly\ntestified that the costs of raising K.O.B. increased with her age: K.O.B. quickly outgrew her\nclothing and shoes, and K.O.B. was active in extracurricular activities that entailed additional\nfees and expenses. Kimberly requested that the child support be increased to at least fourteen\npercent of Charles\u2019 income\u2014around $3,000 per month.\n\u00b65. Also presented at the hearing was uncontested evidence that Charles\u2019 annual income\nhad increased from $211,000 to $260,000. The chancery court found the increase in Charles\u2019\nincome to be \u201cnot insignificant\u201d and factored the increase into the modification\ndetermination.\n\u00b66. For the most part, the chancery court rejected Kimberly\u2019s request to increase the child\nsupport obligation to $3,000 per month. However, the obligation was increased by $170 per\nmonth (from $830 to $1,000). Charles appeals.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b67. The \u201caward of child support is a matter within the discretion of the chancery court,\u201d\n2and it will not be reversed \u201cunless the [chancery court] was manifestly wrong in [its] finding\nof fact or manifestly abused [its] discretion.\u201d Gillespie v. Gillespie, 594 So. 2d 620, 622\n(Miss. 1992). \u201cThe determination of the amount of support needed must be made by a\nchancellor who hears all the facts, views the witnesses, and is informed at trial of the\ncircumstances of the parties and particularly the circumstances of the child.\u201d Id. at 623.\n\u201cThe process of weighing evidence and arriving at an award of child support is essentially\nan exercise in fact-finding, which customarily significantly restraints this Court\u2019s review.\u201d\nKilgore v. Fuller, 741 So. 2d 351, 353 (\u00b64) (Miss. Ct. App. 1999).\nANALYSIS\n\u00b68. Charles argues the increased expenses associated with K.O.B.\u2019s advanced age and his\nincreased income do not constitute a material change in circumstances warranting\nmodification. He contends Kimberly failed to provide sufficient evidence of the increased\nexpenses, and therefore the increase must be reversed.\n\u00b69. A parent seeking modification of child support must show \u201ca substantial or material\nchange in the circumstance[s]\u201d not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the most recent\nsupport decree. Id. at (\u00b66). Our Supreme Court has noted \u201c[t]hat children\u2019s expenses\ngenerally will increase as they get older, that the father and mother\u2019s earning capacity will\ngenerally increase from year to year, and that inflation will continue at some level and will\npartially affect both the children\u2019s expenses and the parents\u2019 earning capacity.\u201d Tedford v.\nDempsey, 437 So. 2d 410, 419 (Miss. 1983) (emphasis omitted).\n\u00b610. While it is foreseeable that expenses increase with the natural growth of a child, the\n3amount of the increase is not. Kilgore, 741 So. 2d at 353 (\u00b66). \u201cAs the Mississippi Supreme\nCourt has recognized, rare is the child whose financial needs do not increase with age.\u201d Id.\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Varner v. Varner, 588 So. 2d 428, 433 (Miss.\n1991)). It would be unfair to require under the foreseeability test that the initial child-support\naward include anticipated future increased expenses. Id. Because it is impossible for a court\nto foresee in the initial support award what allowances to make for a child years into the\nfuture, we leave that for modification proceedings. Id.\n\u00b611. When determining whether modification of child support is warranted, the chancery\ncourt may consider the factors provided in Adams v. Adams, 467 So. 2d 211, 215 (Miss.\n1985).2 \u201cPossible factors which may constitute a material change in circumstances are\nincreases in the children\u2019s expenses; a substantial increase in the financial resources of the\nnon-custodial parent; and inflation since the original decree.\u201d Cox v. Moulds, 490 So. 2d\n866, 869 (Miss. 1986). Evidence of a child\u2019s increased \u201cacademic achievements and\neducational needs together with their extracurricular activities\u201d may be considered in order\nto justify an increase in child support. Havens v. Broocks, 728 So. 2d 580, 583 (\u00b69) (Miss.\nCt. App. 1998).\n2 In determining whether a material change has occurred, chancery courts may\nconsider \u201c(1) the increased needs caused by advanced age and maturity of the children[,] (2)\nincrease in expenses,[] (3) inflation factor[,] . . . (4) the relative financial condition and\nearning capacity of the parties, (5) the health and special medical needs of the child, both\nphysical and psychological, (6) the health and special medical needs of the parents, both\nphysical and psychological, (7) the necessary living expenses of the [paying party], (8) the\nestimated amount of income taxes that the respective parties must pay on the incomes, (9)\nthe free use of residence, furnishings, and automobile and (10) such other facts and\ncircumstances that bear on the support as shown by the evidence.\u201d Id. (citations omitted).\n4\u00b612. We are satisfied that the chancery court\u2019s factual findings were supported by\nsubstantial, credible evidence. As evidenced in its order, the chancery court considered all\nof the Adams factors. The chancery court found that the combination of increased expenses\nassociated with raising K.O.B., Charles\u2019 substantial increase in income, Kimberly\u2019s changed\nfinancial position, and inflation constituted a material change warranting a modification of\nchild support. Furthermore, the chancery court rejected Kimberly\u2019s request for the most part,\ntailoring the support increase to $1,000 per month rather than the requested $3,000 per\nmonth. We find that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\u00b613. Charles also argues that Kimberly\u2019s new husband\u2019s income should be a factor in\ndetermining the amount of support to award. However, \u201c[w]e know of no reason in law,\nmorality or common sense why a father\u2019s obligation to support his children should be\nminimized because his ex-wife remarries well.\u201d Tedford, 437 So. 2d at 420.\n\u00b614. Because the chancery court\u2019s decision was within its discretion, we affirm.\n\u00b615. AFFIRMED.\nBARNES, C.J., J. WILSON, P.J., GREENLEE, WESTBROOKS, TINDELL,\nMcDONALD, LAWRENCE AND C. WILSON, JJ., CONCUR. CARLTON, P.J., NOT\nPARTICIPATING.\n5",

Docket No. 3:17-cr-00221-MMH-JBT-5\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\nversus\nXAVIER THOMAS ALEXANDER,\nDefendant-Appellant.\n________________________\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Florida\n________________________\n(February 6, 2020)\nBefore JORDAN, GRANT, and TJOFLAT, Circuit Judges.\nPER CURIAM:Case: 18-15233 Date Filed: 02/06/2020 Page: 2 of 4\nXavier Alexander appeals his 120-month sentence for conspiracy to\ndistribute cocaine, challenging the district court\u2019s determination that he is a career\noffender for sentencing purposes based on his two prior state felony convictions\nfor sale of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to sell. See Fla. Stat.\n\u00a7 893.13. On appeal, Alexander argues that these crimes cannot be \u201ccontrolled\nsubstance offenses\u201d that trigger the career-offender designation under the\nSentencing Guidelines because (1) the more serious offense of Florida cocaine\ntrafficking is not considered a controlled substance offense, and (2) the Florida\nstatute defining his offenses, \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes, does not contain a\nmens rea requirement as to the illicit nature of the substance involved. These\narguments are foreclosed by the plain language of the Sentencing Guidelines and\nby binding precedent.\nWe review de novo the question whether a defendant qualifies as a career\noffender under the Sentencing Guidelines. United States v. Pridgeon, 853 F.3d\n1192, 1198 n.1 (11th Cir. 2017). To be a career offender, a defendant must have\ntwo or more prior felony convictions that qualify as \u201ceither a crime of violence or a\ncontrolled substance offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines\nManual \u00a7 4B1.1(a). The Guidelines define a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d as a\nfelony that involves \u201cthe manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of\na controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled\n2Case: 18-15233 Date Filed: 02/06/2020 Page: 3 of 4\nsubstance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export,\ndistribute, or dispense.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4B1.2(b).\nIn interpreting these provisions, we apply the usual rules of statutory\nconstruction, beginning with the plain language of the guideline. United States v.\nShannon, 631 F.3d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 2011). In Shannon, therefore, we held\nthat a conviction for Florida cocaine trafficking involving only the purchase of\ncocaine was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because the\npurchase of cocaine \u201cdoes not necessarily give rise to actual or constructive\npossession\u201d of the drug under Florida law, and the act of purchasing cocaine is not\ncovered by the plain language of the guideline. Id. at 1188\u201390. We noted that a\nviolation of the same Florida drug trafficking statute that involved possession with\nintent to distribute cocaine\u2014rather than purchase with intent to distribute\u2014would\nmeet the definition of a controlled substance offense. Id. at 1190 & n.3. Contrary\nto Alexander\u2019s argument, whether a prior state felony is a controlled substance\noffense for purposes of the career-offender guideline depends on whether the state\noffense meets the definition of that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2014not on the seriousness of\nthe offense or the severity of the penalty under state law. Cf. id. at 1190\u201391\n(Marcus, J., specially concurring).\nIn United States v. Smith, we determined that a violation of \u00a7 893.13(1) of\nthe Florida Statutes\u2014which provides that, with exceptions not relevant here, \u201ca\n3Case: 18-15233 Date Filed: 02/06/2020 Page: 4 of 4\nperson may not sell, manufacture, or deliver, or possess with intent to sell,\nmanufacture, or deliver, a controlled substance\u201d\u2014squarely meets the definition of\na \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the Guidelines. 775 F.3d 1262, 1267 (11th\nCir. 2014). We specifically rejected the argument that because the Florida statute\ndoes not require proof that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal, a\nviolation of \u00a7 893.13(1) should not qualify as a controlled substance offense. Id.;\nsee also Pridgeon, 853 F.3d at 1197\u201398. As we explained in Smith, no \u201celement of\nmens rea with respect to the illicit nature of the controlled substance is expressed\nor implied by\u201d the Guidelines definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Smith,\n775 F.3d at 1267. We are bound by this precedent. See, e.g., United States v.\nHarris, 941 F.3d 1048, 1057 (11th Cir. 2019).\nThe district court appropriately applied the career-offender enhancement\nwhen calculating Alexander\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range because his Florida\nfelony convictions for sale of cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to sell\nqualify as controlled substance offenses under the Guidelines. We therefore affirm\nAlexander\u2019s conviction and sentence.\nAFFIRMED.\n4",

It terminated\nhim in December 2015 when it hired a permanent teacher, and rehired him for a\ndifferent substitute teacher position from January to May 2016. Keystone did not\nrehire Mr. Brown for the 2016-17 school year.\nIn April 2017, Mr. Brown sued Keystone for racial discrimination and\nretaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000(e) et seq., and 42\n* This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines\nof law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for\nits persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The district court granted Keystone summary judgment and denied\nhis motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e). Exercising jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual Background\nThe Parties and Keystone\u2019s Hiring Practices\nMr. Brown is licensed by Kansas to teach special education for grades 7 to 12.1\nKeystone is a governmental entity that provides special education services, such as\nhiring teachers for eight school districts in Kansas.2 The John Dewey Learning\nAcademy (\u201cJDLA\u201d) is Keystone\u2019s alternative school program.\nDuring the time relevant to this appeal, Keystone advertised open positions by\n(1) emailing current staff or (2) posting vacancies on the Kansas Teaching Jobs\n(\u201cKTJ\u201d) website. App. at 13, 66, 77, 113.3 If Keystone did not hire an applicant for\na position, it retained the application for approximately 18 months. Id. at 13, 113. If\nKeystone hired an applicant, it removed that person from consideration for new\n1 He also is licensed to teach psychology (7-12), physical education (K-12),\nand health (K-12).\n2 The parties do not contest that Keystone is a state actor. Keystone is a local\ngovernment unit under the Kansas Interlocal Cooperation Act. Kan. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7\u00a7 12-2901 et seq and 72-13,100.\n3 The Kansas Teaching Jobs website is \u201ca place where any school district in\nthe state of Kansas can post job openings.\u201d App. at 66.\n2positions. Id. A hired applicant needed to re-apply for any new full-time or\nsubstitute position. Id.4\nAugust 2015 \u2013 Mr. Brown\u2019s Initial Application\nIn August 2015, Mr. Brown applied for a full-time special education position\n(7-12) and a substitute teacher position (K-12). In September 2015, Keystone Human\nResources Manager Lushena Newman sent Mr. Brown the following letter:\nThis is notification that the substitute teaching position for\nwhich you recently interviewed for has been filled.\nHowever, we will keep your application materials on file\nfor future openings.\nId. at 98.\nOctober to December 2015 Position\nIn October 2015, Keystone hired Mr. Brown as a \u201cSubstitute JDLA Special\nEducation Teacher\u201d at JDLA to teach English to special education students. Id. at\n73. The written employment contract\u2019s start date was October 26, 2015, but the end\ndate was unspecified.\nIn December 2015, Keystone hired a permanent teacher for Mr. Brown\u2019s\nposition and informed him that his last day of employment would be December 17,\n2015. On December 29, 2015, Mr. Brown\u2019s legal counsel sent Keystone a letter\nasserting that \u201cthe only basis for terminating Mr. Brown\u2019s employment is lack of\n4 Keystone did not notify Mr. Brown that after he was hired in October 2015,\nhe was removed from consideration for other positions.\n3funding,\u201d but Mr. Brown\u2019s \u201creplace[ment] by another teacher[] . . . indicat[es] there\nis not a lack of funding.\u201d Id. at 86.\nJanuary to May 2016 Position\nIn January 2016, after meetings between legal counsel for Keystone and Mr.\nBrown, Keystone offered Mr. Brown another position. The written contract was for\nan at-will \u201cSubstitute JDLA Functional Special Education Teacher\u201d position with a\nJanuary 5, 2016 to May 25, 2016 term. Id. at 88.5 Mr. Brown signed the contract and\nworked for the contract\u2019s full term.\nApril 2016 Conversation and Discontinued Employment\nIn an April 28, 2016 meeting,6 JDLA Principal Terri Coughlin offered Mr.\nBrown a non-teaching paraprofessional position in both Keystone\u2019s summer 2016\n\u201cHarvester program\u201d and for the 2016-17 school year. At the same meeting, Mr.\nBrown asked Principal Coughlin about teaching positions for the 2016-17 year, but\nshe said \u201cthat she didn\u2019t have . . . teaching positions available for [him].\u201d Id. at 67.7\n5 Although Mr. Brown did not apply for this position, Keystone claims it\noffered the position to Mr. Brown as part of a \u201cnegotiated settlement\u201d for\n\u201cconciliation.\u201d App. at 11. Mr. Brown disagrees, claiming he was offered the\nposition because \u201c[Keystone] had a position open due to staff changes.\u201d Id. at 112.\n6 In his EEOC charge and complaint in district court, Mr. Brown claimed they\nmet on April 28, 2016. Keystone states that Principal Coughlin offered Mr. Brown a\nposition \u201c[a]t the end of the 2015-16 school year.\u201d App. at 12.\n7 Keystone does not dispute that Principal Coughlin made this statement. See\nOral Arg. at 19:58-20:07.\n4On May 25, 2016, Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel sent Keystone a letter declining \u201ca\nposition for the 2016-2017 school year as a paraprofessional educator\u201d and asking to\nrenew Mr. Brown\u2019s October 26, 2015 contract. Id. at 95. The parties agree Mr.\nBrown rejected a paraprofessional position for the 2016-17 year, but Keystone\ndisputes Mr. Brown\u2019s claim that he accepted the summer 2016 Harvester position.8\nSpring 2016 \u2013 Keystone\u2019s Hiring Actions\nIn spring 2016, Ms. Newman sent the following emails to Keystone\u2019s special\neducation teachers email group:\n\uf0b7 An April 13, 2016 email listing available JDLA \u201cFunctional Skills Teacher\u201d\nand JDLA \u201cEnglish Teacher\u201d positions. Id. at 100. The email asked that \u201c[i]f\nyou have any interest in transferring[,] please notify me in writing.\u201d Id.\n\uf0b7 A May 6, 2016 email showing an available JDLA \u201cFunctional Skills Teacher\u201d\nposition. Id. at 102.\n\uf0b7 Two May 25, 2016 emails reporting no available JDLA positions.\nOn April 22, 2016 and April 29, 2016, Keystone also posted three open special\neducation teacher positions at Keystone for the 2016-17 school year on the KTJ\nwebsite.\n8 Mr. Brown claimed he received an email with a work schedule for the\nHarvester position but the record lacks other evidence that he accepted a position.\nWhen Mr. Brown showed up for his first day of work in the Harvester program, he\nwas sent home. The parties dispute whether the summer Harvester and the 2016-17\nposition were the same or two separate positions. Mr. Brown claims they were two\n\u201cseparate and distinct\u201d positions, and that his rejection of the paraprofessional\nposition was not a rejection of the summer Harvester position. Aplt. Br. at 11.\nKeystone claims they were the same position, and thus asserts that Mr. Brown\u2019s\ncounsel\u2019s May 2016 letter rejected Keystone\u2019s employment offer.\n5B. Procedural Background\nEEOC Charge\nIn July 2016, Mr. Brown dual-filed a \u201cNotice of Charge of Discrimination\u201d\nwith the Kansas Human Rights Commission (\u201cKHRC\u201d) and Equal Employment\nOpportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). He alleged improper conduct occurred from\n\u201cApril 28, 2016 to May 16, 2016,\u201d and described the factual basis for the charges as\nfollows:\nI. I am African American. I have openly opposed acts and\npractices forbidden by the Kansas Act Against\nDiscrimination [(\u201cKAAD\u201d)].\nII. I was employed by [Keystone] from October 26, 2015, to\nMay 16, 2016. I last held the position of Teacher.\nA. On April 28, 2016, I was denied a position for the\n2016-2017 school years. However, on April 22,\n2016 and April 29, 2016, [Keystone] posted several\nteaching positions for the 2016-2017 year.\nB. On May 16, 2016, I was terminated.\nIII. I hereby charge [Keystone] with a violation of the\n[KAAD], in that I was denied a position due to my race,\nAfrican American, and terminated as an act of retaliation\nfor having openly opposed acts and practices forbidden by\nthe [KAAD].\nId. at 108-09.\n6District Court\nOn April 10, 2017, after obtaining a right-to-sue letter, Mr. Brown sued\nKeystone for racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII and 42\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1981.\na. Pretrial order\nThe magistrate judge issued a pretrial order stating Mr. Brown\u2019s racial\ndiscrimination claims and one retaliation claim were brought under Title VII and\n\u00a7 1981. The order referenced Mr. Brown\u2019s contentions that Keystone had\ndiscriminated against him because of his race in\n[(1)] termination of his employment in December 2015,\nand being required to sign a less favorable employment\nagreement in January 2016 in order to preserve his\nemployment, [(2)] being denied employment for the\n2016-2017 school year, and [(3)] being denied employment\nwith the Keystone Harvesters program.\nDist. Ct. Doc. 33 at 5.\nHe also alleged\nthat he was retaliated against for having opposed his\ntermination from employment in December, 2015, in\nviolation of [T]itle VII when he was denied employment\nopportunities with Keystone.\nId.\nb. Summary judgment\nKeystone moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court\ngranted the motion after analyzing the claims for (1) racial discrimination for the\n7December 2015 termination; (2) racial discrimination and retaliation for failure to\nhire Mr. Brown for the 2016-17 school year; and (3) racial discrimination for failure\nto hire Mr. Brown for the summer 2016 Harvester program. The court first addressed\nthese claims under Title VII, and then addressed the same three claims under \u00a7 1981.\ni. Title VII\nUnder Title VII, the district court \u201ceasily [found]\u201d that Mr. Brown had\nexhausted only his second claim\u2014racial discrimination and retaliation for \u201cfailure to\nhire [Mr. Brown] for the 2016\u201317 school year.\u201d Brown v. Keystone Learning Servs.,\nNo. 17-2211-JAR, 2018 WL 6042592, at *5 (D. Kan. Nov. 19, 2018) (unpublished).\nIt dismissed the other claims for failure to exhaust and applied McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), to the second claim only. Id. at *5-9. The\ncourt concluded Mr. Brown had failed to establish that Keystone\u2019s legitimate\nnondiscriminatory reason for its failure to hire him\u2014that it hired only qualified\nteachers who applied for the 2016-17 academic year\u2014was pretextual. Id. at *6-7.\nHe failed to show that his pretext argument, based on Principal Coughlin\u2019s statement\non April 28, 2016 that no 2016-17 positions were available, was \u201cfalse at the time it\nwas made\u201d or an \u201cintentional[] misrepresent[ation].\u201d Id. at *7.\n8The district court also concluded Mr. Brown could not establish a prima facie\ncase of retaliation because he did not engage in \u201cprotected opposition\u201d to the\nDecember 2015 termination. Id. at *8.9\nii. Section 1981 claims\nUnder \u00a7 1981, the district court granted Keystone summary judgment on three\ngrounds. First, \u00a7 1981 claims against a state actor such as Keystone must be brought\nunder 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and Mr. Brown had not done so.10 Second, to prove a\n\u00a7 1983 claim against a municipal defendant like Keystone, the plaintiff must show\nthe municipality\u2019s policy or custom caused the \u00a7 1981 violation, and Mr. Brown\nfailed to do so.11 Third, the second \u00a7 1981 claim failed for the same reasons as the\nsecond Title VII claim.\nc. Denial of Mr. Brown\u2019s motion to alter or amend\nMr. Brown filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule 59(e) to\nalter or amend the judgment, arguing he had established pretext for his Title VII\n9 The district court further determined that Mr. Brown lacked evidence of a\ncausal connection between the \u201callegedly protected activity\u201d in December 2015 and\nKeystone\u2019s \u201cdecision not to hire him as a teacher for the [2016-17] year.\u201d Brown,\n2018 WL 6042592, at *8-*9. Finally, it held that Mr. Brown could not establish\npretext. Id. at *9.\n10 See Jett v. Dall. Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 735 (1989) (explaining\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides \u201cthe exclusive federal damages remedy for the violation of\nthe rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state actor\u201d).\n11 See Monell v.

The motion attached a new affidavit from Mr. Brown\nand screenshots of the KTJ website as it appeared on April 22 and April 29.\nThe district court denied the motion. See Brown v. Keystone Learning Servs.,\nNo. 17-2211-JAR, 2019 WL 858694, at *3 (D. Kan. Mar. 25, 2019) (unpublished). It\n\u201cdecline[d] to consider\u201d as evidence Mr. Brown\u2019s \u201cnew facts and citations\u201d because\nMr. Brown could have presented them in his brief opposing summary judgment. Id.\nat *2.\nII. DISCUSSION\nWe affirm the district court on all claims. The following discussion focuses\nmainly on Mr. Brown\u2019s Title VII claim for race discrimination and retaliation based\non Keystone\u2019s failure to hire him for the 2016-17 school year. We summarily affirm\nhis remaining claims under Title VII and \u00a7 1981. Finally, we affirm the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of Mr. Brown\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion because Mr. Brown tried to offer\nevidence he could have presented at summary judgment.\nA. Standard of Review\n\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying\nthe same legal standard as the district court.\u201d Parker Excavating, Inc. v. Lafarge W.,\nInc., 863 F.3d 1213, 1220 (10th Cir. 2017) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn applying this\nstandard, we view the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d Id. (quotations\nomitted). \u201cThe court shall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is\n10no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\nB. Title VII Race and Retaliation Claim for Failure to Hire for 2016-17\nRacial Discrimination\na. Legal background\nTitle VII prohibits an employer from \u201crefus[ing] to hire . . . any individual . . .\nbecause of such individual\u2019s race.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). \u201cTo survive\nsummary judgment on a Title VII claim of [racial] discrimination,\u201d the plaintiff must\n\u201cpresent either direct evidence of discrimination or indirect evidence that satisfies the\nburden-shifting framework of McDonnell Douglas.\u201d Bekkem v. Wilkie, 915 F.3d\n1258, 1267 (10th Cir. 2019).12 The plaintiff bears \u201c[t]he ultimate burden of\npersuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the\nplaintiff.\u201d Tex. Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253 (1981).\nUnder the three-part McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, the\nplaintiff first bears the \u201cnot onerous\u201d \u201cburden of proving by the preponderance of the\nevidence a prima facie case of discrimination.\u201d Id. at 252-53.13 If the plaintiff meets\n12 \u201cDirect evidence is evidence, which if believed, proves the existence of a\nfact in issue without inference or presumption. Stated differently, direct evidence\ndemonstrates on its face that the employment decision was reached for discriminatory\nreasons.\u201d Riggs v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 497 F.3d 1108, 1117 (10th Cir. 2007)\n(quotations, citations, and brackets omitted).\n13 To establish a prima facie failure-to-hire claim, \u201c[t]he plaintiff must show:\n(i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job\n11the prima facie burden, the employer bears the \u201cexceedingly light\u201d burden to\n\u201carticulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for not hiring the plaintiff.\nDePaula v. Easter Seals El Mirador, 859 F.3d 957, 970 (10th Cir. 2017) (quotations\nomitted). The employer\u2019s explanation must be \u201clegally sufficient to justify a\njudgment for the defendant\u201d by \u201cclearly set[ting] forth . . . admissible evidence.\u201d\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 255; see also DePaula, 859 F.3d at 973 (explaining defendant\nrecounted plaintiff\u2019s performance issues in termination letter). \u201cIf the defendant\narticulates a nondiscriminatory reason, the burden shifts back to plaintiff to show a\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendant\u2019s reason . . . is pretextual.\u201d\nDewitt v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 845 F.3d 1299, 1308 (10th Cir. 2017) (quotations\nomitted).\nOn appeal, the parties address the pretext step. A plaintiff may show pretext\n\u201cindirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of\ncredence.\u201d Burdine, 450 U.S. at 256; see also Swackhammer v. Sprint/United Mgmt.\nCo., 493 F.3d 1160, 1167 (10th Cir. 2007) (quotations omitted) (explaining a plaintiff\nmay show pretext by demonstrating \u201cweaknesses . . . or contradictions in the\nemployer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons\u201d such \u201cthat a reasonable factfinder could\nrationally find them unworthy of credence\u201d).\nfor which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications,\nhe was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the\nemployer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.\u201d\nBurdine, 450 U.S. at 253 n.6 (quotations omitted).\n12In evaluating a plaintiff\u2019s evidence of pretext, courts \u201cexamine the facts as\nthey appear to the person making the decision,\u201d not \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s subjective\nevaluation.\u201d DePaula, 859 F.3d at 970 (quotations omitted). Courts \u201cmay not\nsecond guess the [employer\u2019s] business judgment,\u201d but must ask \u201cwhether the\nemployer honestly believed those reasons and acted in good faith upon those beliefs.\u201d\nId. at 970-71 (quotations omitted).\nb. Analysis\nBecause Mr. Brown has offered no direct evidence to prove discrimination\n\u201cwithout inference or presumption,\u201d Riggs v. AirTran Airways, Inc., 497 F.3d 1108,\n1117 (10th Cir. 2007), like the district court, we apply the McDonnell Douglas\nburden-shifting framework.\nOn appeal, Keystone does not contest that Mr. Brown established a prima facie\ncase. Aplee. Br. at 32-33. Mr. Brown does not contest that Keystone provided a\nlegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, see Aplt. Br. at 28: that \u201c[Keystone] selected\nand hired teachers for the 2016-17 school year from the individuals who actually\napplied and were qualified for those positions,\u201d App. at 25. Instead, Mr. Brown\nchallenges the district court\u2019s determination that his evidence was \u201cinsufficient to\ndemonstrate pretext.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 26.\nMr. Brown must carry his burden to show pretext. See Dewitt, 845 F.3d at\n1308. His primary evidence is Principal Coughlin\u2019s statement on April 28, 2016,\n\u201cthat she didn\u2019t have . . . teaching positions available for [him].\u201d App. at 67. He\n13contends this statement was \u201cfalse\u201d and that she \u201chad reason to know that her\nstatement was false.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 31. But even if a reasonable jury could infer her\nstatement was incorrect,14 it does not undermine Keystone\u2019s legitimate,\nnondiscriminatory reason for not hiring Mr. Brown for 2016-17\u2014that it hired only\nthose who applied and were qualified. Principal Coughlin\u2019s statement did not\naddress whether Mr. Brown applied or was qualified. It therefore did not\ndemonstrate \u201cweaknesses . . . or contradictions in [Keystone\u2019s] proffered reasons,\u201d\nsuch that a \u201creasonable [jury] could rationally find them unworthy of credence.\u201d\nSwackhammer, 493 F.3d at 1167.\nApart from relying on Principal Coughlin\u2019s statement, Mr. Brown attempts to\nshow he applied for 2016-17 positions. First, Mr. Brown claims Ms. Newman\u2019s\nSeptember 2015 letter about keeping his August 2015 application on file meant he\nwould be considered for future openings. But under Keystone\u2019s practices, once he\nwas hired in October 2015 and rehired in January 2016, he needed to apply for any\nnew position. Second, he contends he did not receive Ms. Newman\u2019s spring emails\nnotifying interested employees to apply for open 2016-17 positions. But whether he\nreceived the emails does not change the fact that Keystone did not receive an\n14 A reasonable jury could infer that Keystone had 2016-17 positions available\non April 28, 2016. Ms. Newman\u2019s April 13 and May 6 emails show an open JDLA\n\u201cFunctional Skills Teacher\u201d position. App. at 100, 102. Ms. Newman\u2019s April 13\nemail shows an open \u201cJDLA English Teacher position,\u201d although it was not listed in\nher May 6 email. Id. On April 22 and April 29, 2016, Keystone also posted three\n2016-17 year special education teacher positions on the KTJ website.\n14application from him, and we examine the facts as they appeared to Keystone. See\nDePaula, 859 F.3d at 970-71.15 Third, Mr. Brown points to his expression of interest\nin 2016-17 positions during his April 28, 2016 meeting with Principal Coughlin. But\nthis does not show he applied. Fourth, Mr. Brown argues he accepted the summer\nparaprofessional Harvester position and received an email with a work schedule. But\nthis was not a teaching position and did not extend to the 2016-17 school year. And\nalthough Mr. Brown\u2019s counsel\u2019s May 25, 2016 letter to Keystone inquired about\nrenewing his contract for 2016-17, Keystone \u201cunderstood from [the] letter that [he]\nwould not accept any position other than the substitute teaching position he held the\nprevious year.\u201d Aplee. Br. at 6. In sum, the record lacks evidence that he applied for\nor was offered a teaching position for the 2016-17 year.16\n* * * *\nEven if Mr. Brown raised an issue of fact regarding the accuracy of Principal\nCoughlin\u2019s statement, no reasonable jury could infer that the statement undermined\nKeystone\u2019s reasons for failing to hire him for the 2016-17 year.\n15 Principal Coughlin\u2019s statement about no available positions and Mr.\nBrown\u2019s contention that he did not receive Ms. Newman\u2019s emails may raise a\nquestion whether Keystone attempted to impede Mr. Brown\u2019s opportunity to apply\nfor 2016-17 positions. But Mr. Brown has not relied on that basis for his claim or\npresented evidence to support it, and Keystone thus has not attempted to discredit it.\n16 Because Mr. Brown fails to show as pretextual Keystone\u2019s reason that he\nfailed to apply for 2016-17 positions, we do not address Keystone\u2019s other reason that\nhe was unqualified.\n15Retaliation\na. Legal background\nTitle VII prohibits an employer from \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against any individual\n. . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by\nthis subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To survive summary judgment on a Title\nVII retaliation claim, a plaintiff must either directly \u201cshow that retaliatory animus\nplayed a \u2018motivating part\u2019 in the employment decision,\u201d or \u201crely on the [McDonnell\nDouglas] burden-shifting framework . . . to prove retaliation indirectly.\u201d Parker\nExcavating, Inc., 863 F.3d at 1220.\nUnder the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff establishes a prima facie\ncase of retaliation by showing (1) the plaintiff engaged in \u201copposition to racial\ndiscrimination that is protected under the statute,\u201d (2) \u201ca reasonable person would\nhave found the challenged action materially adverse,\u201d and (3) \u201ca causal connection\nexisted between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d Id. \u201cAlthough no\nmagic words are required, to qualify as protected opposition the employee must\nconvey to the employer his or her concern that the employer has engaged in a\npractice made unlawful by [Title VII].\u201d Hinds v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 523 F.3d\n1187, 1203 (10th Cir. 2008). A plaintiff\u2019s \u201c[p]rotected opposition can range from\nfiling formal charges to voicing informal complaints to superiors.\u201d Hertz v. Luzenac\nAm., Inc., 370 F.3d 1014, 1015 (10th Cir. 2004).\n16Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, \u201cthe alleged retaliator [may]\noffer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its conduct.\u201d Parker Excavating, Inc.,\n863 F.3d at 1220. If satisfied, \u201cthe plaintiff must show the employer\u2019s reason was\nmerely a pretext for retaliation.\u201d Id.\nb. Analysis\nMr. Brown claims that Keystone failed to hire him for the 2016-17 year in\nretaliation for his \u201cprotected opposition\u201d to his December 2015 termination. Because\nhe offers no direct evidence that retaliatory animus motivated Keystone\u2019s\nemployment decision, we analyze his retaliation claim under the McDonnell Douglas\nburden-shifting framework. See id.\nMr. Brown has failed to demonstrate a prima facie case. His sole action in\nresponse to his December 2015 termination was his counsel\u2019s December 29, 2015\nletter. This letter was not \u201cprotected opposition.\u201d It did not \u201cconvey to [Keystone]\n. . . that [it] ha[d] engaged in a practice\u201d violating Title VII. Hinds, 523 F.3d at 1203.\nThe letter did not mention or imply racial discrimination. Nor did Mr. Brown \u201cfil[e]\nformal charges\u201d or \u201cvoic[e] informal complaints\u201d that his December 2015\ntermination was racially discriminatory. Hertz, 370 F.3d at 1015. Summary\njudgment was therefore appropriate.17\n17 On appeal, Mr. Brown appears to raise a second retaliation claim: that\nKeystone made his January 5, 2016 to May 25, 2016 contract less favorable than his\nOctober 2015 contract in retaliation for his December 2015 opposition. Keystone\ncontends this claim was not preserved and is without merit because he never engaged\n17C. Remaining Claims\nWe affirm the district court on Mr. Brown\u2019s remaining claims. Mr. Brown\nfailed to exhaust his other Title VII claims and failed to plead his \u00a7 1981 claims\nunder \u00a7 1983.\nTitle VII \u2013 Failure to Exhaust\nTo bring a Title VII claim, a plaintiff must file a charge of discrimination with\neither the EEOC or an authorized state or local agency and receive a right to sue\nletter. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1), 2000e-5(f)(1). \u201cEach incident of\ndiscriminatory or retaliatory treatment . . . must be exhausted,\u201d Lincoln v. BNSF Ry.\nCo., 900 F.3d 1166, 1181 (10th Cir. 2018) (quotations and brackets omitted),\nmeaning \u201cthe charge must contain facts . . . underlying each claim,\u201d Smith v.\nCheyenne Ret. Inv\u2019rs L.P., 904 F.3d 1159, 1164 (10th Cir. 2018) (quotations and\nbrackets omitted). A plaintiff\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies is not a\njurisdictional bar. See Lincoln, 900 F.3d at 1183. It \u201cpermits a defendant only an\naffirmative defense . . . subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling.\u201d Id. \u201cWe\nreview the district court\u2019s legal determination that a plaintiff has failed to exhaust her\nadministrative remedies de novo.\u201d Cheyenne, 904 F.3d at 1164.\nin protected activity. Without deciding whether this claim was properly preserved,\nwe find it meritless because Mr. Brown failed to show his December 2015 actions\nwere \u201cprotected opposition.\u201d\n18Although Mr. Brown timely filed his EEOC and KHRC charge and received a\nright to sue letter from the EEOC, he failed to exhaust \u201ceach discrete incident of\ndiscriminatory or retaliatory treatment.\u201d Lincoln, 900 F.3d at 1181 (quotations and\nbrackets omitted). His EEOC/KHRC charge \u201ccontain[ed] facts . . . underlying\u201d his\nclaim about Keystone\u2019s failure to hire him for the 2016-17 year. Cheyenne, 904 F.3d\nat 1164 (quotations omitted). It listed the dates of the incident as \u201cApril 28, 2016 to\nMay 16, 2016\u201d and stated he \u201cwas denied a position for the 2016-2017 school years.\u201d\nApp. at 108. But the EEOC/KHRC charge lacked facts underlying his other claims.\nWe therefore affirm the district court\u2019s determination that only his 2016-17 failure-\nto-hire claim was properly exhausted under Title VII.18\nSection 1981 \u2013 Failure to Plead \u00a7 1983\nTitle 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 provides \u201cthe exclusive federal . . . remedy for the\nviolation of the rights guaranteed by \u00a7 1981 when the claim is pressed against a state\nactor.\u201d Jett v. Dall. Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 735 (1989). The district court\ndismissed Mr. Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims because he failed to plead them under \u00a7 1983.\nOn appeal, Mr. Brown argues that the amendments to \u00a7 1981 in the Civil\nRights Act of 1991 permit him to bring his \u00a7 1981 claims without alleging them\nunder \u00a7 1983. See Aplt. Br. at 17-18 (asserting that \u00a7 1981 \u201chas its own standard for\n18 Keystone raised its affirmative defense of non-exhaustion regarding the\nother claims in its August 7, 2017 answer to Mr. Brown\u2019s complaint and the pretrial\norder.\n19liability and remedies\u201d which \u201cdo[] not require a Plaintiff to defer to \u00a7 1983\nremedies\u201d).19 But we have held the amendments did not alter Jett\u2019s holding that\n\u00a7 1983 is the \u201cexclusive federal remedy\u201d for \u00a7 1981 actions against state actors.\nBolden v. City of Topeka, Kan., 441 F.3d 1129, 1136-37 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotations\nomitted) (\u201cThe amendments to \u00a7 1981 . . . hardly confront[] the holding in Jett.\u201d).\nWe therefore affirm the district court\u2019s determination that Mr. Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims\nmust be dismissed.20\nD. Rule 59(e) Motion\n\u201cWe review the [district court\u2019s] denial of a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or\namend a judgment for abuse of discretion.\u201d Monge v. RG Petro-Machinery (Grp.)\nCo. Ltd., 701 F.3d 598, 610 (10th Cir. 2012) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. Rule 59(e)). \u201cTo\nsupport a Rule 59(e) motion with additional evidence . . . the moving party must\nshow (1) that the evidence is newly discovered, or (2) if the evidence was available at\nthe time summary judgment was granted, that counsel made a diligent yet\nunsuccessful attempt to discover the evidence.\u201d Id. at 611 (quotations omitted).\nThe district court\u2019s refusal to consider Mr. Brown\u2019s additional evidence\nattached to his Rule 59(e) motion\u2014(1) his affidavit and (2) Keystone\u2019s April 22,\n19 Mr. Brown asserts he does not seek to amend the complaint to bring his\n\u00a7 1981 claims under \u00a7 1983.

Id.\nWe affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 59(e) motion.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nWe affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment for Keystone and denial of\nMr. Brown\u2019s Rule 59(e) motion.\nEntered for the Court\nScott M. Matheson, Jr.\nCircuit Judge\n21 In his EEOC charge, see App. at 108, and in his complaint, see Dist. Ct.\nDoc. 2 at 4, Mr. Brown stated that Keystone placed job postings online on April 22\nand April 29, 2016. Ms. Newman\u2019s deposition testimony also identified the\nsubstantive information contained within the job postings on the KTJ website. The\nexclusion of the job postings as evidence does not preclude our consideration of their\nexistence in considering Mr. Brown\u2019s pretext evidence.\n21",

Mohammad Hoq, a native and citizen of Bangladesh,\npetitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA\u2019s) decision\ndismissing his appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) 2016 and 2012 decisions\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).finding him removable and denying his applications for asylum, withholding of\nremoval, protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and adjustment\nof status. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and we deny the\npetition in part and dismiss it in part. Because the parties are familiar with the\nfactual history of the proceedings, we do not recount it here.\n1. The BIA correctly determined that Petitioner is statutorily barred from\nasylum because he previously filed a frivolous asylum application. See 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1158(d)(6). \u201cWhether the IJ complied with the BIA\u2019s four procedural\nrequirements for a frivolousness finding is a question of law we review de novo.\u201d\nLiu v. Holder, 640 F.3d 918, 925 (9th Cir. 2011). The BIA properly concluded the\nPetitioner had knowledge of the consequences of filing a frivolous application.\nPetitioner testified before the IJ that he filed a fraudulent application under the\nfictitious name Kalam Ullah. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s findings\nthat Petitioner read and understood the notice contained in the asylum application.\nPetitioner testified that he signed the asylum application that contained the written\nwarning, and that he took English as a second language in college and could read\nEnglish at the time he attended the asylum interview. See Cheema v. Holder, 693\nF.3d 1045, 1049\u201350 (9th Cir. 2012) (holding that the written warning on the\n2asylum application adequately notifies the applicant of the consequences of filing a\nfrivolous application).\n2. We lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioner\u2019s challenges to\nremovability because he failed to exhaust these claims before the agency. 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1252(d)(1).\n3. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s adverse\ncredibility determination and consequently their conclusion that Petitioner is not\nentitled to withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. Petitioner\u2019s\nfraudulent application and appearance before the asylum officer, his withdrawal of\nhis first asylum application, and his two voluntary returns to Bangladesh support\nthe finding that he is not credible. Because Petitioner did not provide independent\ncorroborating evidence, and his claims turned on his own testimony, the IJ\nproperly determined that Petitioner was not entitled to withholding of removal or\nprotection under the CAT.\n4. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of adjustment of\nstatus as a matter of discretion. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); Bazua-Cota v.\nGonzales, 466 F.3d 747, 748 (9th Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (\u201c[T]he decision to deny\nPetitioner\u2019s application for adjustment of status is a discretionary determination,\nand is therefore unreviewable.\u201d).\n3PETITION DENIED IN PART AND DISMISSED IN PART.\n4",

As debtor in this bankruptcy proceeding, Oracle seeks damages from\nEPI Consultants for alleged breach of contract and negligence in connection\nwith EPI\u2019s consulting services on the well. Oracle alleges that, because of EPI\u2019s\nactions, Oracle suffered expenses and loss of future profits from the well.\nEPI avers that Oracle cannot establish that it is entitled to any damages.\nEPI contends that Brooks\u2019s other companies\u2014not Oracle\u2014paid all invoices for\nthe well\u2019s expenses.

The district court1 sentenced Montes-Gutierrez to 135 months of imprisonment,\nbelow the 168 to 210 month range recommended by the United States Sentencing\nGuidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) and calculated by the district court.\nWhen determining the Guidelines range, the district court determined Montes-\nGutierrez\u2019s base offense level was 38 due in part to the amount of methamphetamine\ninvolved in his offense. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (providing drug quantity table\nfor determining base offense level). This conclusion was dependent on testimony by\nan informant, who claimed Montes-Gutierrez and another man had provided him\napproximately fifteen pounds of methamphetamine.\nOn appeal, Montes-Gutierrez argues the district court wrongly credited the\ninformant\u2019s testimony about the amount of drugs he bought from Montes-Gutierrez\nand thus improperly calculated the offense level and Guidelines range. According to\nMontes-Gutierrez, the informant\u2019s testimony was not to be believed because it was\ninconsistent, unreliable, and uncorroborated.\nReviewing the district court\u2019s drug-quantity determination for clear error, we\nreject Montes-Gutierrez\u2019s credibility-based challenge. See United States v. Spencer,\n592 F.3d 866, 881 (8th Cir. 2010) (setting forth the standard of review and our\ndeference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations). The district court\ncogently explained its reasons for believing the informant witness regarding the\namount of methamphetamine involved in the offense, and we detect no clear error in\nits conclusion.\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n______________________________\n1The Honorable Leonard T.

Defendant first moves to\ndismiss the Complaint, ECF No. 1, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Second, Defendant\nmoves to transfer this case to the United States District Court for the Western District of North\nCarolina pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a). Lastly, Defendant moves for summary judgment with\nrespect to whether the actions of the agency at issue, the United States Citizenship and Immigration\nServices (\u201cUSCIS\u201d), were arbitrary and capricious. Upon consideration of the briefing,2 the\n1 Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d), Kenneth T. Cuccinelli is substituted as\nDefendant for former Director L. Francis Cissna. See Kenneth T.

(\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 11;\n\u2022 Resp. in Opp\u2019n to Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss, Mot. to Transfer, and Mot. for Summ. J. (\u201cPl.\u2019s\nOpp\u2019n\u201d), ECF No. 12; and\n1relevant legal authorities, and the record as relevant to this Motion, the Court GRANTS\nDefendant\u2019s Motion on the basis that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this case. The\nCourt therefore DENIES AS MOOT Defendant\u2019s alternative Motion to Transfer and Motion for\nSummary Judgment.\nI. BACKGROUND\nPlaintiff Selvin Leonardy Solis Meza is a citizen and national of Honduras who currently\nresides in Pineville, North Carolina. Compl. \u00b6 1. He is married to a United States citizen and has\ntwo children who are also United States citizens. Id. He originally entered the United States in\n2002 and was apprehended by immigration officials. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8\u20139. According to Mr. Solis, the\nimmigration officials chose to \u201cparole\u201d him into the United States. Id. \u00b6 10. They served him with\na notice to appear, which initiated removal proceedings. Id. \u00b6 11. The notice to appear described\nMr. Solis as an \u201carriving alien.\u201d Id.\nLater, on January 26, 2018, Mr. Solis\u2019s wife filed a Petition for an Alien Relative (Form I-\n130) on Mr. Solis\u2019s behalf. Id. \u00b6 15. He contemporaneously filed an Application to Register\nPermanent Residence or Adjust Status (Form I-485, referred to here as \u201cAdjustment Application\u201d).\nId. \u00b6 16. After interviewing Mr. Solis and his wife, USCIS issued a notice of intent to deny his\nApplication on the basis that Mr. Solis was not an arriving alien. Id. \u00b6 19. Mr. Solis provided them\nwith a copy of his notice to appear that indicated he was an arriving alien. Id. \u00b6 21. However, the\nagency still denied his Adjustment Application on the basis that it lacked jurisdiction because Mr.\nSolis was not an arriving alien. Id. \u00b6 22; see id. Ex. A (denial letter), ECF No. 1-5.\n\u2022 Reply in Further Supp. of Def.\u2019s Mot. to Dismiss or, Alternatively, Mot. to Transfer or,\nAlternatively, Mot. for Summ. J. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Reply\u201d), ECF No. 13.\nIn an exercise of its discretion, the Court finds that holding oral argument would not be of\nassistance in rendering a decision. See LCvR 7(f).\n2Mr. Solis then brought this suit, which primarily argues that the agency\u2019s denial of his\nApplication was arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d). See,\ne.g., id. \u00b6 4 (invoking APA); id. \u00b6\u00b6 28\u201339 (outlining claim titled \u201cAPA\u2014Adjustment Application\nDenial\u201d).\nII. LEGAL STANDARD\nA court must dismiss a case pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(1) when it lacks subject matter\njurisdiction. In determining whether there is jurisdiction, the Court may \u201cconsider the complaint\nsupplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record, or the complaint supplemented by\nundisputed facts plus the court\u2019s resolution of disputed facts.\u201d Coal. for Underground Expansion\nv. Mineta, 333 F.3d 193, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Herbert\nv. Nat\u2019l Acad. of Scis., 974 F.2d 192, 197 (D.C. Cir. 1992)); see also Jerome Stevens Pharm., Inc.\nv. Food & Drug Admin., 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\u201c[T]he district court may consider\nmaterials outside the pleadings in deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of\njurisdiction.\u201d).\nIn reviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), courts must accept as true all\nfactual allegations in the complaint and construe the complaint liberally, granting plaintiff the\nbenefit of all inferences that can be drawn from the facts alleged. See Settles v. U.S. Parole\nComm\u2019n, 429 F.3d 1098, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (\u201cAt the motion to dismiss stage, counseled\ncomplaints as well as pro se complaints, are to be construed with sufficient liberality to afford all\npossible inferences favorable to the pleader on allegations of fact.\u201d); Leatherman v. Tarrant Cty.\nNarcotics Intelligence & Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163, 164 (1993) (\u201cWe review here a decision\ngranting a motion to dismiss, and therefore must accept as true all the factual allegations in the\ncomplaint.\u201d); Koutny v. Martin, 530 F. Supp. 2d 84, 87 (D.D.C. 2007) (\u201c[A] court accepts as true\n3all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint and may also consider \u2018undisputed facts\nevidenced in the record.\u2019\u201d (internal citations omitted) (quoting Mineta, 333 F.3d at 198)).\nDespite the favorable inferences that a plaintiff receives on a motion to dismiss, it remains\nthe plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. Am.\nFarm Bureau v. United States Envtl. Prot. Agency, 121 F. Supp. 2d 84, 90 (D.D.C. 2000).\n\u201cAlthough a court must accept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint when\nreviewing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), [a] plaintiff[\u2019s] factual allegations in the\ncomplaint . . . will bear closer scrutiny in resolving a 12(b)(1) motion than in resolving a 12(b)(6)\nmotion for failure to state a claim.\u201d Wright v. Foreign Serv. Grievance Bd., 503 F. Supp. 2d 163,\n170 (D.D.C. 2007) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (quoting Grand Lodge of\nFraternal Order of Police v. Ashcroft, 185 F. Supp. 2d 9, 13\u201314 (D.D.C. 2001)), aff\u2019d, 2008 WL\n4068606 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 17, 2008). A court need not accept as true \u201ca legal conclusion couched\nas a factual allegation\u201d or an inference \u201cunsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.\u201d Trudeau\nv. Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted)\n(quoting Papasam v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 286 (1986)).\nIII. DISCUSSION\nDefendant argues that the case should be dismissed because this Court lacks subject matter\njurisdiction. In short, Defendant argues that under the relevant statutes, there is no jurisdiction\nbecause Mr. Solis is challenging a denial of an adjustment of status while there is a pending\nremoval proceeding with respect to Mr. Solis. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5\u20137. Mr. Solis, in response, contends\nthat because there is no pending removal proceeding and because he seeks review of a purely legal\nmatter, this Court has jurisdiction. The Court addresses the relevant statutory and regulatory\nscheme, and how it has been applied in this context, before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments here.\n4Some background on the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme provides context for the\nparties\u2019 arguments. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) created a process, called\n\u201cadjustment of status,\u201d by which \u201ccertain aliens physically present in the United States could seek\nlawful permanent resident status without having to depart this country.\u201d Landin-Molina v. Holder,\n580 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir. 2009). However, in cases in which an alien who is not an arriving alien\n\u201chas been placed in deportation proceedings or in removal proceedings,\u201d the Immigration Judge\nin the Department of Justice\u2019s Executive Office for Immigration Review (\u201cEOIR\u201d) \u201chas exclusive\njurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status the alien may file.\u201d 8 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i); see also 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.1(a)(1)(ii) (granting immigration judge in removal\nproceeding authority to determine applications for adjustment of status); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2(a)(1)\n(\u201cUSCIS has jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by any alien,\nunless the immigration judge has jurisdiction to adjudicate the application under 8 CFR\n1245.2(a)(1).\u201d).\nIf an Immigration Judge denies such an application, the alien may appeal to the Board of\nImmigration Appeals. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b) (outlining appellate jurisdiction of Board of\nImmigration Appeals, which includes \u201c[d]ecisions of Immigration Judges in removal\nproceedings\u201d); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.3(a) (providing process for appeals of decisions by Immigration\nJudges to Board of Immigration Appeals). Certain questions in final decisions by the Board of\nImmigration Appeals related to removal proceedings may be appealed to the appropriate federal\nCourt of Appeals. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (\u201c[A] petition for review filed with an appropriate\ncourt of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial\nreview of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter[.]\u201d); id.\n\u00a7 1252(b)(2) (\u201cThe petition for review shall be filed with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit\n5in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.\u201d); id. \u00a7 1252(b)(9) (\u201cJudicial review\nof all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and application of constitutional and\nstatutory provisions, arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from\nthe United States under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order\nunder this section.\u201d (emphasis added)); see also Vetcher v. Sessions, 316 F. Supp. 3d 70, 76\n(D.D.C. 2018) (\u201cTaken together, then, these two subsections streamline all issues arising from\nremoval proceedings into a petition for review that must be filed with a court of appeals after a\nfinal order of removal from the BIA.\u201d).\nThe \u201cpetition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals\u201d is \u201cthe sole and\nexclusive means for judicial review\u201d of a removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5); see also Lee v.\nU.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., 592 F.3d 612, 620 (4th Cir. 2010) (\u201cTo the extent Congress\ndecided to permit judicial review of a constitutional or legal issue bearing upon the denial of\nadjustment of status, it intended for the issue to be raised to the court of appeals during removal\nproceedings.\u201d). Under this scheme, aliens generally are \u201cnot entitled, at any stage in this process,\nto review of [their] application[s] in any district court.\u201d Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296,\n306 (D.D.C. 2017); see also, e.g., Abdelwahab v. Frazier, 578 F.3d 817, 821 (8th Cir. 2009)\n(finding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) \u201cdoes not grant jurisdiction to review questions of law in\ndistrict court cases\u201d but instead grants limited jurisdiction over such questions to the appropriate\ncourt of appeals); Hassan v. Chertoff, 543 F.3d 564, 566 (9th Cir. 2008) (finding that 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1252 grants limited jurisdiction to review denials of application for adjustment of status only to\ncourts of appeals, and not to district courts).\nSince the enactment of the INA in 1952, various statutes, such as the 2005 REAL ID Act,\nhave \u201climited the scope of federal court review respecting certain immigration benefits\n6determinations.\u201d Mamigonian v. Biggs, 710 F.3d 936, 943 (9th Cir. 2013). Under the current\nscheme, judicial review of a discretionary denial of an adjustment of status application is generally\nprecluded by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). See, e.g., Hassan v. Chertoff, 593 F.3d 785, 788\u201389 (9th\nCir. 2010) (per curiam) (\u201c[J]udicial review of the denial of an adjustment of status application\u2014a\ndecision governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\u2014is expressly precluded by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).\u201d).\nSo too is judicial review of discretionary decisions more generally precluded under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). See id. at 789. Even though section 1252 \u201cgenerally addresses judicial review\nwith regard to final orders of removal,\u201d certain language in the statute\u2014\u201cregardless of whether the\njudgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings\u201d\u2014\u201cmakes clear that the\njurisdictional limitations imposed by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B) also apply to review of agency decisions\nmade outside of the removal context.\u201d Lee, 592 F.3d at 619; see Mejia Rodriguez v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of\nHomeland Sec., 562 F.3d 1137, 1142 n.13 (11th Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (finding same); Jilin\nPharm. USA, Inc. v. Chertoff, 447 F.3d 196, 199 n.5 (3d Cir. 2006) (finding same).\nBut several courts have generally distinguished between non-discretionary, or purely legal,\ndenials of status of adjustment applications and the discretionary denials for which review is\nstatutorily precluded.3 The Third Circuit examined this issue in Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193\n(3d Cir. 2005). As the court there explained, when it comes to subject matter jurisdiction in this\n3 These determinations happen both in the context of the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of\nsection 1252 as well as in the context of the APA, which similarly requires that the agency action\nbe non-discretionary. See, e.g., Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193, 200 & n.9 (3d Cir. 2005) (noting\nthat agency action must be non-discretionary under APA and explaining that \u201cSection\n1252(a)(2)(B) of Title 8 of the United States Code, which also strips the district courts of\njurisdiction over discretionary agency determinations, is in that respect at least partly duplicative\nof the APA requirement\u201d); Maalouf v. Wiemann, 654 F. Supp. 2d 6, 8 n.6 (D.D.C. 2009) (noting\nthat 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), \u201cwhich expressly forbids any court from reviewing discretionary\nrelief granted under Section 13, is largely duplicative of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 to the extent the latter\nprovision generally forbids courts from reviewing discretionary agency action\u201d).\n7context, courts must \u201cdistinguish carefully between a denial of an application to adjust status, and\na determination that an immigrant is legally ineligible for adjustment of status.\u201d Id. at 203. An\n\u201cimmigrant\u2019s eligibility itself is determined by statute,\u201d and as such is \u201cplainly [a] matter[] of\nlaw[.]\u201d Id. This is because \u201c[d]etermination of eligibility for adjustment of status\u2014unlike the\ngranting of adjustment itself\u2014is a purely legal question and does not implicate agency discretion.\u201d\nId. at 204. Other circuits have similarly found that some legal questions raised in these proceedings\nmay be reviewable. See, e.g., Hosseini v. Johnson, 826 F.3d 354, 359 & n.6 (6th Cir. 2016) (finding\nthat \u201ccourts can review non-discretionary decisions in this context,\u201d including \u201celigibility\ndeterminations underlying the agency\u2019s decision,\u201d and explaining that \u201cif Congress had intended\nto limit district court jurisdiction over non-discretionary determinations, it could have done so with\nunambiguous language to that effect in \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)\u201d); Mamigonian, 710 F.3d at 945\n(\u201c[D]istrict courts have jurisdiction to hear cases challenging final agency determinations\nrespecting eligibility for the immigration benefits enumerated in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) made\non nondiscretionary grounds, provided there are no pending removal proceedings in which an alien\ncould apply for such benefits.\u201d); Lee, 592 F.3d at 620 (\u201cCongress made explicit that despite the\njurisdiction-stripping language of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), courts of appeal [retain] a narrowly\ncircumscribed jurisdiction to resolve constitutional claims or questions of law raised by aliens\nseeking discretionary relief.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Higuit v. Gonzales,\n433 F.3d 417, 419 (4th Cir. 2006))); Mejia Rodriguez, 562 F.3d at 1144\u201345 (finding that section\n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not preclude district court from exercising jurisdiction over claims \u201cbecause\nsuch non-discretionary, statutory eligibility decisions made by USCIS fall outside the limitations\non judicial review in the INA\u201d).\n8There are other limits on the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in this context as well. Mr. Solis bases\nhis claims on the APA, which provides that \u201c[a]gency action made reviewable by statute and final\nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court are subject to judicial\nreview.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (emphasis added); see also Cabaccang v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration\nServs., 627 F.3d 1313, 1315 (9th Cir. 2010) (\u201cNo statute authorizes judicial review over denials of\nstatus adjustment, so the sole issue here is whether USCIS\u2019s denial of the [plaintiffs\u2019] applications\nwas a \u2018final\u2019 agency action for which there was no other adequate remedy.\u201d). The Supreme Court\nhas explained that \u201ctwo conditions must be satisfied for agency action to be \u2018final[.]\u2019\u201d Bennett v.\nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177 (1997). The first is that \u201cthe action must mark the \u2018consummation\u2019 of\nthe agency\u2019s decisionmaking process,\u201d which means that \u201cit must not be of a merely tentative or\ninterlocutory nature.\u201d Id. at 177\u201378 (quoting Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S.\nCorp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948)). \u201c[S]econd, the action must be one by which \u2018rights or\nobligations have been determined,\u2019 or from which \u2018legal consequences will flow[.]\u2019\u201d Id. at 178\n(quoting Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U.S. 62,\n71 (1970)).\nConsequently, \u201c[f]inality requires exhaustion of administrative remedies.\u201d Pinho, 432 F.3d\nat 200. In the context of the previously outlined statutory scheme, \u201c[i]f there remain steps that the\nimmigrant can take to have an action reviewed within the agency, then the action is not final and\njudicial review is premature.\u201d Id. Courts have therefore found that when plaintiffs may obtain\nreview of denials of adjustment of status applications through other agency avenues, such as\nremoval proceedings, this requirement is not met. See, e.g., Cabaccang, 627 F.3d at 1316\u201317\n(\u201cSimilarly, the pendency of removal proceedings means the Cabaccangs have not exhausted their\nadministrative remedies. . . . The Cabaccangs presently have the ability to reopen their applications\n9to adjust status during their pending removal proceedings. Undoubtedly they will do so. Until\nthey have exhausted this available administrative remedy, the district court cannot hear their\nclaim.\u201d); McBrearty v. Perryman, 212 F.3d 985, 987 (7th Cir. 2000) (\u201cThe suit was premature,\nsince, as the plaintiffs acknowledge, they could obtain review of the district director\u2019s decision by\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals if and when the immigration service institutes removal (i.e.,\ndeportation) proceedings against them. They thus have failed to exhaust their administrative\nremedies.\u201d (citation omitted)); Ramat v. Nielsen, 317 F. Supp. 3d 1111, 1117 (S.D. Cal. 2018)\n(\u201cThus, as a result of the Immigration Court\u2019s pending removal proceedings against Plaintiff, his\nAPA claim is not ripe for adjudication, and this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to hear his\nAPA claim.\u201d); Mahon v. Johnson, 321 F. Supp. 3d 320, 324 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (\u201cHere, Mahon has\nfailed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and, therefore, the Court does not have\njurisdiction. . . . Mahon has the opportunity to renew her application before the Immigration Judge\nin removal proceedings.\u201d); Soliz v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Servs., No. CIV A 207-CV-\n00148, 2007 WL 1753543, at *3 (S.D. W. Va. June 18, 2007) (\u201cMr. Soliz has not exhausted his\nadministrative remedies . . . when an adjustment of status application has been denied, it may be\nrenewed in removal proceedings. At this stage, therefore, the sole avenue for review of the denial\nof Mr. Soliz\u2019s adjustment of status application is before the immigration judge (\u2018IJ\u2019) at the removal\nproceedings.\u201d (citations omitted)).\nAccordingly, the courts that have considered this issue\u2014including the D.C. Circuit\u2014have\nfound that in general, district courts lack subject matter jurisdiction to review the denial of an\nadjustment of status application if there is a removal proceeding through which the plaintiff may\nseek relief. See, e.g., Jama v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 760 F.3d 490, 497 (6th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]e\nhold that termination of refugee status and denial of a status adjustment application are not \u2018final\n10agency actions\u2019 reviewable in district court under the APA[.]\u201d); Maalouf v. Wiemann, No. 09-5394,\n2010 WL 4156654, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 17, 2010) (affirming district court\u2019s dismissal of case\nbecause challenge to decision that plaintiff was \u201cineligible for adjustment of status\u201d was \u201cnot ripe\nfor judicial review while removal proceedings [we]re pending against her\u201d); Cabaccang, 627 F.3d\nat 1317 (\u201cAccordingly, we join our sister circuits in holding that district courts lack jurisdiction to\nreview denials of status adjustment if removal proceedings are simultaneously pending.\u201d); Howell\nv. I.N.S., 72 F.3d 288, 293 (2d Cir. 1995) (\u201cIn the present case, we think that the district court\nlacked jurisdiction to review the district director\u2019s denial of [the plaintiff]\u2019s application for\nadjustment of status once deportation proceedings commenced, because [the plaintiff] failed to\nexhaust her administrative remedies.\u201d); Randall v. Meese, 854 F.2d 472, 480\u201381 (D.C. Cir. 1988)\n(finding that plaintiff must take \u201cnormal appeal route\u201d and that district court lacked subject matter\njurisdiction over denial of status adjustment when removal proceedings were pending);\nMassignani v. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 438 F.2d 1276, 1277 (7th Cir. 1971) (finding\nthat district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff would \u201chave another\nopportunity to present her application for permanent residence\u201d in removal proceedings); Ahlijah\nv. Nielsen, No. CV PX-17-1720, 2018 WL 3363875, at *3 (D. Md. July 10, 2018) (\u201cBecause [the\nplaintiff\u2019s] removal proceedings are ongoing in Immigration Court, [the plaintiff] has not yet been\nsubject to a final decision as to deportation or removal.\u201d), aff\u2019d, 755 F. App\u2019x 290 (4th Cir. 2019);\nJafarzadeh, 270 F. Supp. 3d at 305 (\u201cIt is well established that an individual may not challenge a\ndenial of an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident in district court while\nremoval proceedings are pending.\u201d).\nHowever, courts have generally refrained from finding there is no jurisdiction when there\nis no way for plaintiff to seek relief through a removal proceeding. An illustrative example is\n11Hosseini v. Johnson, 826 F.3d 354 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court,\nwhich had concluded that it lacked jurisdiction in a case challenging the denial of an adjustment\nof status application. Id. at 357\u201359. But the plaintiff in Hosseini did not, at any point, have any\nremoval proceedings initiated against him. Id. at 361. The government argued that the fact that\nthe agency could, at some hypothetical future time, bring removal proceedings against the plaintiff\nmeant that the agency\u2019s denial was not sufficiently final. Id. at 361\u201362. The court rejected that\nargument. See id. In particular, the court was concerned that because the agency had discretionary\ncontrol over whether to initiate removal proceedings, precluding review of a plaintiff\u2019s claim could\nallow the agency to control whether a claim might be brought before the courts. See id. at 362.\nOther courts have found the same. See, e.g., Mamigonian, 710 F.3d at 945 (explaining that Ninth\nCircuit has made clear \u201cthat for purposes of the APA, \u2018[w]ithout a pending removal proceeding, a\ndenial of status adjustment is final because there is no appeal to a superior administrative\nauthority\u2019\u201d (quoting Cabaccang, 627 F.3d at 1317)); Pinho, 432 F.3d at 201 (finding that when\nthere were no removal proceedings, plaintiff \u201chad no further opportunity to challenge the legality\nof the decision within the agency, and would have none at all, were he forced to await deportation\nproceedings that the agency may or may not choose to institute\u201d); Chen v. Reno, No. 96 CIV. 5792\n(RPP), 1997 WL 316482, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 11, 1997) (finding that jurisdiction was proper\nbecause plaintiff had \u201cexhausted his administrative remedies because as a denied applicant not in\ndeportation proceedings, he ha[d] no further options under the regulatory or statutory scheme to\nforce a prompt decision by the INS\u201d). At least one court has also found there may be subject\nmatter jurisdiction when a plaintiff is \u201cprecluded from submitting or renewing an application for\nadjustment of status before an [Immigration Judge] during removal proceedings,\u201d such as when\nthat plaintiff qualifies as an \u201carriving alien.\u201d Mamigonian, 710 F.3d at 945.\n12In this case, Defendant argues that a \u201ca removal proceeding is pending against plaintiff\u201d\nand, as a result, he must first seek review of the denial of his adjustment of status application with\nan Immigration Judge and appeal it to the Board of Immigration Appeals before seeking judicial\nreview in the relevant circuit court of appeals. See Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5\u20136. Defendant refers to an\nOrder of Removal issued August 8, 2002 and a Warrant of Removal/Deportation dated January 12,\n2004. See id. at 5. In response, Mr. Solis argues that this Court has jurisdiction because \u201cno\nremoval proceedings are currently pending.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2. He concedes that removal\nproceedings were initiated against him in 2002 and that he was ordered removed in 2002. Id.\nHowever, he explains, because there are no ongoing removal proceedings, jurisdiction lies. See\nid. The Court agrees with Defendant.\nWhat Mr. Solis\u2019s primary argument overlooks is that, under the legal scheme outlined\nabove, the question is whether he has exhausted administrative remedies. It is true that in many\ncases, including the case that Defendant cites several times, Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d\n296 (D.D.C. 2017), there were parallel removal proceedings happening at the same time as the\ndistrict court case. But Mr. Solis in this case still has not exhausted his administrative remedies\nbecause he has not sought to move to reopen his removal proceedings so that his adjustment of\nstatus application can be adjudicated there. Mr. Solis must avail himself of any administrative\nremedies available to him, which includes seeking adjudication of his adjustment of status\napplication in a reopened removal proceeding. As noted above, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i),\nthe Immigration Judge presiding over any removal proceeding has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to\nadjudicate any application for adjustment of status\u201d that an alien may file.\nMr. Solis suggests that he cannot avail himself of this route because he is an arriving alien,\nand \u201cthe Board of Immigration Appeals has held that it has no jurisdiction to consider an\n13adjustment of status application for an arriving alien with a final order of removal.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n\nat 2. It is true that the jurisdictional provision in section 1245.2(a)(1)(i) does not apply to an\narriving alien. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i). But USCIS has specifically determined that Mr.\nSolis does not qualify as an arriving alien. See Compl. Ex. 5, ECF No. 1-5, at 2. Because USCIS\nfound that Mr. Solis was not an arriving alien, USCIS found that it lacked jurisdiction in light of\nsection 1245.2(a):\nSince you are a respondent in a removal proceeding, and you are not an \u201carriving\nalien\u201d only EOIR has jurisdiction to grant or deny your Form I-485[.] See Title 8,\nCode of Federal Regulations (8 CFR), sections 252.2(a) and 1245.2(a). You must\nsubmit your Form I-485 to the Immigration Judge in EOIR proceedings. Since\nEOIR has already entered a removal order, you must move EOIR to reopen the\nproceedings in order for you to be able to apply for adjustment of status.\nBecause USCIS does not have jurisdiction, your Form I-485 is administratively\nclosed; however, this does not prevent you from seeking adjustment before EOIR.\n8 CFR sections 245.2(a)(1) and 1245(a)(1).\nId. Ex. 5 at 2. In light of the finding that he is not an arriving alien, Mr. Solis has not explained\nhow the decision upon which he relies, In re Yauri, 25 I. & N. Dec. 103, 106\u201307 (BIA 2009), would\napply to his application. Indeed, in In re Yauri, there was neither a dispute that the alien was an\narriving alien nor a finding by USCIS that she was not an arriving alien. See id. at 104 (noting that\nalien \u201cacknowledge[d] that she [was] an \u2018arriving alien\u2019\u201d).\nIn any event, it is far from clear that In re Yauri should be accorded deference. For instance,\nthe Ninth Circuit held in Singh v. Holder, 771 F.3d 647 (9th Cir. 2014), that \u201cthe Board of\nImmigration Appeals has authority to reopen proceedings of an alien who is under a final order of\nremoval in order to afford the alien an opportunity to pursue an adjustment of status application\nbefore [USCIS],\u201d id. at 649. In doing so, it accorded no deference to In re Yauri because it found\nthat the Board\u2019s holding in that case ignored \u201cthe unambiguous language of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a),\nwhich states that \u2018[t]he Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in\n14which it has rendered a decision.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a)). Regardless, the Board\u2019s\nholding in In re Yauri is distinguishable here.\nAdministrative remedies are therefore still available to Mr. Solis. He may move to reopen\nhis removal proceeding to adjudicate his adjustment of status application there. See generally,\ne.g., 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a (outlining in various subsections process for reopening removal\nproceedings); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2 (same). If his attempt is denied, or if his application is denied, he\nmay ultimately be able to appeal to the relevant federal Court of Appeals. See, e.g., Singh, 771 F.3d\nat 650 (\u201cThe denial of a motion to reopen is a final administrative decision subject to our judicial\nreview. Our jurisdiction arises under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.\u201d (citation omitted)); cf. Kucana v. Holder,\n558 U.S. 233, 252 (2010) (finding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) does not strip courts of\njurisdiction to review BIA\u2019s denial to reopen removal proceedings even when discretionary denial\nauthority stemmed from regulation and not statute). Either way, this court has no subject matter\njurisdiction to hear his case and it must be dismissed on that basis.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, ECF No. 11, is GRANTED.\nThis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Mr. Solis\u2019s case. The Court therefore DENIES\nAS MOOT Defendant\u2019s alternative Motion to Transfer and Motion for Summary Judgment.

We\naffirmed the denial of plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motion, finding that the trial court did\nnot abuse its discretion by refusing to allow her medical expert to perform a\ndemonstration of a medical procedure before the jury that was dissimilar to the\nmedical procedure actually performed on her by the treating physician. The trial\ncourt also committed no abuse of discretion by preventing plaintiff\u2019s medical\nexpert from offering opinions about the causation and permanency of certain of\nher injuries, where the expert had no reliable basis for those opinions.No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 2 Plaintiff, Nicole Ackerman, filed a medical malpractice action against defendants,\nRockford G. Yapp, M.D., Digestive Health Services, S.C,. and Advocate Health and Hospitals\nCorporation1, alleging that Dr. Yapp committed medical malpractice when he perforated her\nesophagus while performing an endoscopy to remove a dental appliance that she had swallowed.\nPlaintiff contended that to repair the esophageal perforation, another surgeon performed a\nthoracotomy, in which her chest was opened and the tear was sewn up. Plaintiff allegedly\nsuffered permanent injuries from the thoracotomy, which never would have happened had Dr.\nYapp not negligently perforated her esophagus in the first place.\n\u00b6 3 Plaintiff alleged that Dr. Yapp\u2019s negligence resulted from his use of a latex hood in the\ncourse of the endoscopy to remove the dental appliance, and that he should have used a so-called\n\u201covertube\u201d instead, which would have reduced the chance of an esophageal perforation from\noccurring. Plaintiff also alleged that Dr. Yapp failed to obtain her informed consent for the\nprocedure and that Digestive Health Services was vicariously liable for the actions of Dr. Yapp\nand for institutional negligence.\n\u00b6 4 The jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the\ntrial court erred by: (1) refusing to allow her expert, Dr. Catalano, to demonstrate to the jury how\nan overtube could have been used to safely remove the dental appliance without perforating her\nesophagus; (2) precluding Dr. Catalano from offering causation opinions as to her post-surgical\nbowel evacuation problems; and (3) preventing Dr. Catalano from testifying about the\npermanency of her injuries. We affirm.\n\u00b6 5 I. Pretrial Proceedings\n1 Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation was voluntarily dismissed from the lawsuit\nafter the motions in limine.\n- 2 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 6 Prior to trial, the court was informed that the dental device had been discarded, and that\nplaintiff wished to use a replica of the device for demonstrative purposes at trial and to show the\njury that the device could have safely fit inside of an overtube and been removed from her body\nwithout perforating her esophagus. Defendants filed a motion in limine to bar the use of the\nreplica at trial. The court denied the in limine motion and allowed plaintiff to show the jury the\ndevice and describe it as an \u201cexemplar,\u201d but not as a \u201creplica.\u201d\n\u00b6 7 Defendants also filed a motion in limine to bar Dr. Catalano\u2019s testimony that four of\nplaintiff\u2019s alleged injuries are permanent in nature: acid reflux, pain around the surgical site,\nconstipation, and range of motion. Defendants argued in support of their motion that a physician\nmay not testify to a patient\u2019s prognosis unless his opinions are based on a recent examination.\nThere was no evidence that plaintiff had been examined by any treating physician for more than\ntwo years prior to trial. Dr. Catalano never met or examined plaintiff; his opinions about her\ncurrent condition and the permanency of her injuries were primarily based on a single telephone\nconversation he had with her the night before his deposition.\n\u00b6 8 The trial court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, allowing evidence that\nplaintiff\u2019s scars and acid reflux disease were permanent, but barring evidence that her range of\nmotion injuries and constipation and pain around the surgical area were permanent.\n\u00b6 9 II. Trial\n\u00b6 10 At trial, plaintiff testified that the dental device at issue was a so-called \u201cflipper,\u201d which\nfit in the space where she had two missing teeth. The device could be snapped in place like a\nretainer and had a clasp on the back and a wire in front and it had sharp edges. In the early\nmorning on April 20, 2011, while kissing her boyfriend, the flipper became dislodged and passed\ndown her throat. The next morning, plaintiff went to Good Samaritan Hospital\u2019s emergency\n- 3 -No. 1-18-2708\nroom and told the emergency room personnel that she had swallowed a dental appliance with\nsharp edges. An x-ray was taken, which was reviewed by the emergency room physician. He\nadvised plaintiff that the flipper needed to be removed, and that he would send for a doctor who\ncould perform the removal.\n\u00b6 11 Dr. Yapp subsequently came into the emergency room and stated that he was the doctor\nwho would perform the removal. Dr. Yapp told plaintiff that he would \u201cgo down [her] throat,\u201d\nand \u201cgrab the [flipper] and then bring it up\u201d through her throat. Plaintiff expressed concern that\nduring the removal, she might be injured by the sharp metal on either side of the flipper. Dr.\nYapp explained that the instrument he would use during the removal contained a hood that\nwould cover the flipper to prevent it from hurting her. Plaintiff signed a consent form for the\nprocedure.\n\u00b6 12 Dr. Yapp testified that he is a gastroenterologist who has practiced for over 25 years and\nhas had experience in removing hundreds of foreign bodies from patients. On April 20, 2011, Dr.\nYapp was employed by a practice group he had founded, Digestive Health Services. Dr. Yapp\nwas called to the Good Samaritan Hospital emergency room by Dr. Steven Crouch to see\nplaintiff, who had swallowed a \u201cdangerous device.\u201d Dr. Yapp reviewed the abdominal x-ray,\nwhich revealed a device with a \u201cvery long and torturous wire\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s stomach.\n\u00b6 13 Dr. Yapp spoke with plaintiff and obtained a description from her as to the \u201csize and\ncomplexity and the danger of this device.\u201d Plaintiff informed him that the device was a flipper,\nwhich was a \u201clarge dental inserted plate that had two teeth and wires connected to it to help hold\nit in place.\u201d Dr. Yapp discussed different options with plaintiff. One option was to do nothing,\nwhich current medical literature recommended against because the flipper could travel into the\n- 4 -No. 1-18-2708\nsmall bowel and cause a \u201ccomplication.\u201d Dr. Yapp also discussed the possibility of surgery with\nplaintiff.\n\u00b6 14 Dr. Yapp recommended removal of the flipper through her esophagus endoscopically. Dr.\nYates explained that the endoscopic procedure contained a risk of perforation of the esophagus.\nPlaintiff agreed to the endoscopic procedure.\n\u00b6 15 Dr. Yapp performed an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on plaintiff. Dr. Yapp\u2019s\ninitial approach or \u201cpass\u201d into plaintiff\u2019s stomach was by way of the endoscope, which has a\ncamera and a light at its tip that gives the physician visibility as to the contents of the stomach.\nOn the first pass, Dr. Yapp saw the flipper in plaintiff\u2019s stomach and took two pictures of it with\nthe camera at the tip of the endoscope. Dr. Yapp saw that the flipper posed a danger to plaintiff\nas it had multiple sharp edges and \u201ca wire almost like a fishhook.\u201d The flipper was over two and\na half centimeters in length, meaning that it would be difficult to remove. Dr. Yapp believed that\nthe best way to remove the flipper without harming plaintiff was to utilize a bell-shaped, latex\nhood, about five centimeters in diameter, that would cover the flipper during its removal from\nplaintiff\u2019s body.\n\u00b6 16 Dr. Yapp withdrew the endoscope from the initial pass and fit the hood over the scope.\nDr. Yapp reinserted the endoscope, utilized a snare to stabilize it, and pulled the flipper\ncompletely into the hood. Dr. Yapp then pulled the endoscope and attached hood up the upper\nesophageal sphincter and out plaintiff\u2019s mouth and successfully retrieved the flipper.\n\u00b6 17 Dr. Yapp identified plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 6, 7, and 8 as photographs of the flipper he\nremoved from plaintiff. Plaintiff was permitted to publish Exhibit 7 to the jury.\n- 5 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 18 After Dr. Yapp performed the EGD on plaintiff, her subsequent treating surgeon, Dr.\nSchwartz, found a three-centimeter laceration, located just above the lower esophageal sphincter.\nDr. Yapp testified as follows regarding the laceration of the esophagus:\n\u201cQ. Can you tell us which way the esophagus turns\u2014\nA. The lower esophageal sphincter is a *** circumferential muscle [that] holds\nthe esophagus closed. The shape of the stomach, there is a slight curve that pushes on one\nside of the sphincter and the other side of the sphincter. So it\u2019s not completely\nsymmetrical. ***\nQ. And so that curve right above the lower esophageal sphincter, that adds what\nyou might call a degree of difficulty to the removal of the sharp\u2014\nA. And complexity, correct.\nQ. Complexity because it is an area, whereas you navigate the endoscope and the\nforeign object, they both have to turn with the esophagus otherwise there could be\nlaceration and perforation?\nA. It\u2019s high risk.\nQ. And it\u2019s in that area where [plaintiff] was lacerated and punctured?\nA. In that area, yes.\u201d\n\u00b6 19 Dr. Schwartz subsequently performed a thoracotomy, in which he opened plaintiff\u2019s chest\nand sewed up the tear in her esophagus.\n\u00b6 20 Dr. Yapp was shown plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 25, which he identified as an esophageal\novertube, a piece of equipment that can be used during an endoscopy. An overtube has a number\nof uses, including to protect a patient\u2019s airway during the removal of a foreign object, and\nprotecting the mucosal lining of the esophagus. The standard diameter of the overtube is 1.67\n- 6 -No. 1-18-2708\ncentimeters. The overtube has a flexible distal tip that allows for \u201cstable passage into the\npatient.\u201d Plaintiff was permitted to publish the sample overtube to the jurors so that they could\nsee it and touch it.\n\u00b6 21 Plaintiff questioned Dr. Yapp as to whether he agreed that the flexible distal tip of the\novertube would allow objects larger than 1.67 centimeters (such as the flipper) to be pulled\ninside the overtube. Dr. Yapp disagreed, stating that it would have been \u201cdangerous\u201d to try to\npull the flipper into the distal tip of the overtube. After seeing the size of the flipper, which was\nmeasured at 2.0 by 1.7 by 0.3 centimeters, Dr. Yapp determined that the flipper would not fit\ninside a standard overtube. Dr. Yapp decided that pulling the flipper into the latex hood was the\nsafest way to extract it from plaintiff. Dr. Yapp noted that the latex hood was \u201cclearly made for\nlarger devices,\u201d such as the flipper here. Had he used the overtube, \u201cit\u2019s possible [the flipper]\ncould have gotten stuck and then [he] would really be in a difficult shape.\u201d In Dr. Yapp\u2019s\nopinion, he complied with the standard of care in his treatment of plaintiff.\n\u00b6 22 Dr. Marc Catalano testified as plaintiff\u2019s expert in gastroenterology. Dr. Catalano was\nshown plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 25, which was an overtube that can be used to help remove a foreign\nobject from the patient\u2019s stomach. Dr. Catalano described the distal tip of the overtube as \u201cvery\npliable,\u201d such that it can be torqued and stretched in multiple different directions, longitudinally\nand radially, allowing for the \u201ccapturing of much larger objects than can otherwise be\naccommodated.\u201d\n\u00b6 23 Dr. Catalano opined that the standard of care required Dr. Yapp to use a 50-centimeter\novertube to safely remove the flipper from inside plaintiff\u2019s stomach. Dr. Catalano explained that\nthe only thing that can protect the esophagus from a large, sharp edged object such as the flipper\nis an overtube \u201cthat would encircle the entire esophagus.\u201d\n- 7 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 24 Dr. Catalano was shown plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 20, which was the exemplar flipper2. The\nexemplar contained two teeth, a molar and a premolar, with two metal protruding wires, one\nmore curved than the other. The exemplar was longer than the actual flipper swallowed by\nplaintiff; according to Dr. Catalano, the actual flipper was 2.0 centimeters in length, whereas the\nexemplar was 2.3 centimeters in length. Plaintiff requested that Dr. Catalano be allowed to\nmanually manipulate the exemplar into the distal tip of the overtube in front of the jury, so as to\ndemonstrate that the actual flipper swallowed by plaintiff (which was smaller than the exemplar)\nwould have also fit inside of the overtube. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s request, finding that\nthe proposed demonstration, in which Dr. Catalano would use his hands to manipulate the\nexemplar into the distal tip of the overtube, was not allowable because it was too dissimilar to the\nactual circumstances faced by Dr. Yapp during the EGD he performed on plaintiff, when he\nutilized an endoscope (not his hands) to pull the flipper out of her stomach.\n\u00b6 25 The court permitted Dr. Catalano to draw a diagram to aid the jury in understanding his\ntestimony. Dr. Catalano drew the diagram of the esophagus, diaphragm and stomach and\nexplained how the esophagus includes the lower esophageal sphincter, which is a complex\nmuscle inside the stomach. Dr. Catalano explained that the sharp edges of the flipper posed a\ndanger of perforating the esophagus during its removal, especially because the surgeon\u2019s vision\nduring the endoscopy is limited and because the esophagus is curved, requiring some deft\nmaneuvering by the surgeon. In Dr. Catalano\u2019s opinion, the standard of care for removing the\nflipper without damaging the esophagus was to pull the flipper into the distal tip of the\n50-centimeter esophageal overtube, and then to extract the overtube from the body.\n2 The actual flipper swallowed by plaintiff, and the exemplar flipper, were made the same\nway using a mold of plaintiff\u2019s mouth.\n- 8 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 26 Plaintiff sought to question Dr. Catalano about his opinion that plaintiff suffers\npermanent constipation and pain caused by the thoracotomy that was performed to repair the\nesophageal perforation negligently caused by Dr. Yapp. The trial court refused to allow Dr.\nCatalano to so testify, finding that he had no reasonable basis to support his opinion regarding\nthe cause and permanency of plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\n\u00b6 27 Dr. Peter Kahrilas testified as an expert in gastroenterology for defendants. Dr. Kahrilas\nhas experience removing sharp objects from patients\u2019 stomachs, including a razor blade that he\nremoved via a latex hood fitted over the end of an endoscope. The purpose of the latex hood is to\nprotect the lining of the esophagus from the sharp object contained within.\n\u00b6 28 Dr. Kahrilas identified plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 25 as an overtube. Dr. Kahrilas explained that\nthe primary purpose of an overtube is to prevent asphyxiation from occurring during an\nendoscopic procedure, by allowing the doctor to remove small objects such as food particles so\nas to prevent them from falling into the trachea and choking the patient.\n\u00b6 29 Dr. Kahrilas opined that Dr. Yapp\u2019s decision to remove the flipper by an endoscopy using\na latex hood, as opposed to an overtube, was within the standard of care because the flipper\nwould not have fit inside the overtube.\n\u00b6 30 Dr. John Losurdo testified as an expert in gastroenterology and interventional endoscopy\non behalf of defendants. Dr. Losurdo has removed dental appliances such as dentures and partials\nfrom patients in the past, but he had never before removed a flipper such as the one plaintiff here\nswallowed. Dr. Losurdo noted that the flipper was irregularly shaped and was too large and too\nlong to be pulled into an overtube. Dr. Losurdo opined that Dr. Yapp complied with the standard\nof care by removing the flipper by an endoscopy using a latex hood, as opposed to an overtube.\n- 9 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 31 Following all the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants. Plaintiff\nfiled a posttrial motion, arguing that the trial court erred by: (1) refusing her request to have her\nexpert, Dr. Catalano, demonstrate to the jury that the exemplar would fit inside of the distal tip of\nthe overtube; and (2) precluding Dr. Catalano from testifying that plaintiff\u2019s bowel issues and\npain complaints were permanent and could have been caused by the thoracotomy procedure\nnecessitated by Dr. Yapp\u2019s negligence. The trial court denied plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motion.\nPlaintiff appeals.\n\u00b6 32 III. Analysis\n\u00b6 33 First, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in denying her posttrial motion for a new\ntrial based on the court\u2019s refusal to allow Dr. Catalano to demonstrate to the jury that he could\nmanually fit the exemplar into the distal tip of the overtube. We review the denial of plaintiff\u2019s\nposttrial motion for an abuse of discretion. Stamp v. Sylvan, 391 Ill. App. 3d 117, 123 (2009).\nThe court\u2019s decision as to whether or not to allow a courtroom demonstration is also reviewed\nfor an abuse of discretion. People v. Oliver, 306 Ill. App. 3d 59, 73 (1999).\n\u00b6 34 \u201cIn deciding whether the trial court abused its discretion reviewing courts look \u2018primarily\nto whether the demonstration is probative of facts in issue and whether it is conducted under\nsubstantially similar conditions and circumstances as those which surrounded the original\noccurrence.\u2019\u201d Id. at 73-74 (quoting People v. Harp, 193 Ill. App. 3d 838, 843 (1990)).\n\u00b6 35 The trial court here found that the proposed courtroom demonstration by Dr. Catalano\nwas not substantially similar to the conditions and circumstances surrounding the EGD\nperformed by Dr. Yapp on plaintiff. In denying plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motion, the trial court\nelaborated on its findings:\n- 10 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u201cPlaintiff prepared a video of a retrieval of an exemplar device using an overtube,\nwhich was shown, to the court and parties, outside the presence of the jury. In the video,\nthe demonstration retrieval of an exemplar flipper using an overtube procedure was\ncarried out horizontally, on a flat table, and the exemplar was manually drawn towards\nthe overtube. No one was viewing the retrieval through an endoscope, the exemplar was\nnot inside an actual person\u2019s stomach, and the individual was demonstrating the retrieval\nwhile standing next to the table with the exemplar and device lying flat on the table.\nDr. Catalano, himself, demonstrated to the court what he intended to demonstrate\nto the jury, without the video. The court had to remind Dr. Catalano more than once, to\nrefrain from pushing the exemplar flipper into the distal port of the overtube with his\nfingers. *** This was because Dr. Catalano, by using his fingers, was in effect applying\nforce to secure the exemplar in the overtube. This type of force to the flipper would and\ncould not be used in the actual procedure, since the physician\u2019s hand would not be in the\npatient\u2019s stomach. There was no showing that the amount of force generated by a person\npushing the exemplar into the distal end of the overtube could be duplicated by a person\nmanipulating equipment inside an endoscope, inside a person under sedation, and\npossibly with limited ability to generate force, and limited visibility.\nThe overall effect of the demonstration by Dr. Catalano was, in this court\u2019s\nopinion, to make the retrieval using the overtube, look deceptively easy. The\ndemonstration by Dr. Catalano was not at all similar to the actual circumstance\nencountered by Dr. Yapp, while he was manipulating the endoscope and retrieval\nequipment including a hood located inside a patient\u2019s throat and stomach, with restricted\nvisibility.\u201d\n- 11 -No. 1-18-2708\n\u00b6 36 The court noted that it had allowed Dr. Catalano to \u201cdiscuss his theory of the case and to\ndraw diagrams before the jury that illustrated his theory of using an overtube to retrieve the\nflipper swallowed by [plaintiff].\u201d The exemplar and the overtube were shown to the jury, as\nvisual aids, during Dr. Catalano\u2019s testimony. However, the court found that \u201c[t]he demonstration\nretrieval using an overtube and an exemplar was properly banned *** since it did not meet the\n\u2018substantially similar\u2019 requirement ***. Exclusion of this demonstration does not warrant\ngranting plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial.\u201d\n\u00b6 37 The trial court was correct in finding that Dr. Catalano\u2019s proposed demonstration was not\nsubstantially similar to Dr. Yapp\u2019s actual procedure performed on plaintiff, where: Dr. Yapp\nutilized an endoscope to withdraw the flipper into a latex hood and out her mouth, while Dr.\nCatalano planned to force the exemplar into the distal tip of the overtube with his hands instead\nof with an endoscope; Dr. Yapp withdrew the flipper from plaintiff\u2019s stomach past the\nesophageal sphincter, where the esophagus made a significant turn, while Dr. Catalano\u2019s\ndemonstration would take place on a flat table outside of an actual person\u2019s stomach; and\nDr. Yapp had limited visibility due to the placement of the flipper inside plaintiff\u2019s stomach,\nwhereas Dr. Catalano would face no similar visibility restrictions during his demonstration.\nAccordingly, the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in refusing to allow Dr. Catalano\u2019s\ncourtroom demonstration, and in denying plaintiff\u2019s posttrial motion.\n\u00b6 38 Plaintiff also argues that, even if Dr. Catalano\u2019s demonstration was properly excluded,\nthe trial court abused its discretion by failing to allow Dr. Catalano to testify to the diameter of\nthe distal tip of the overtube. Plaintiff argues that such testimony would have informed the jury\nthat the flipper could have fit inside the distal tip and would have supported her theory that Dr.\n- 12 -No. 1-18-2708\nYapp was negligent for failing to utilize an overtube when retrieving the flipper from her\nstomach.\n\u00b6 39 Review of the record belies plaintiff\u2019s argument, as Dr. Catalano specifically testified that\nthe diameter of the overtube is two centimeters and that the distal tip \u201cexpands to two, two-and-\na-half centimeters or more,\u201d and can \u201caccommodate objects that are twice the size\u201d of the tip.\nThus, Dr. Catalano was not precluded from testifying to plaintiff\u2019s theory of the case; he was,\nhowever, precluded from giving a demonstration under circumstances that were not substantially\nsimilar to the circumstances faced by Dr. Yapp when he performed the EGD on plaintiff. As\ndiscussed, the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in so preventing such a dissimilar\ndemonstration from being performed in front of the jury.\n\u00b6 40 Next, plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in denying her posttrial motion for a new\ntrial based on the court\u2019s refusal to allow Dr. Catalano to give his opinion that plaintiff\u2019s\nconstipation and pain around her surgical site was permanent and could have resulted from the\nthoracotomy procedure that was performed to repair the esophageal perforation negligently\ncaused by Dr. Yapp. To lay an adequate foundation for expert testimony, plaintiff must establish\nthat the witness qualifies as an expert \u201cby knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d\nIll. R. Evid. 702 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011). Plaintiff must also establish that the information on which the\nexpert bases his opinion is reliable. People v. Simmons, 2016 IL App (1st) 131300, \u00b6 115. The\ninformation is reliable if \u201cit is \u2018of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field\nin forming opinions or inferences upon the subject.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Ill. R. Evid. 703 (eff. Jan. 1,\n2011)).\n\u00b6 41 In the present case, the trial court found such reliability lacking in Dr. Catalano\u2019s\nopinions about the cause and permanency of plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The court noted that\n- 13 -No. 1-18-2708\nDr. Catalano is not a cardiothoracic surgeon and does not perform thoracotomies; instead, he is a\ngastroenterologist. Dr. Catalano had a one-hour phone conversation with plaintiff the day before\nhis deposition, reviewed Dr. Yapp\u2019s two depositions and Dr. Schwartz\u2019s deposition, and\nexamined plaintiff\u2019s medical records prior to formulating his opinions. None of the deposition\ntestimony or medical records indicated that plaintiff\u2019s continuing pain and constipation were\ndefinitively caused by the thoracotomy performed on her more than five years ago or that they\nwere permanent. Further, Dr. Catalano never examined plaintiff, never viewed her surgical scar,\nand never consulted with her treating physicians. In fact, no treating physician had examined\nplaintiff for more than two years prior to trial, meaning that no recent medical information about\nher constipation and pain around the surgical site was even available.\n\u00b6 42 The trial court found that without any expertise in performing thoracotomies, and without\nperforming an examination of plaintiff, or reviewing a medical record of a recent examination,\nDr. Catalano lacked information reasonably relied on by experts in the field to form an opinion\nabout whether the thoracotomy caused plaintiff\u2019s continuing constipation and pain and whether\nsuch conditions were permanent. The trial court committed no abuse of discretion in so finding,\nand in barring Dr. Catalano from testifying about the causation and permanency of plaintiff\u2019s\ninjuries.\n\u00b6 43 Plaintiff argues, though, that Dr. Catalano would have testified that plaintiff\u2019s continuing\nconstipation and pain could or might have been caused by the thoracotomy, which meets the\n\u201cmight or could\u201d standard set forth in Mesick v. Johnson, 141 Ill. App. 3d 195 (1986), Geers v.\nBrichta, 248 Ill. App. 3d 398 (1993), and Iaccino v. Anderson, 406 Ill. App. 3d 397 (2010). In\nMesick, Geers, and Iaccino, the appellate court held that \u201ca physician may testify to what might\n- 14 -No. 1-18-2708\nor could have caused an injury despite any objection that the testimony is inconclusive.\u201d Mesick\n141 Ill. App. 3d at 205-06; Geers, 248 Ill. App. 3d at 407; Iaccino 406 Ill. App. 3d at 407.\n\u00b6 44 However, a physician may testify to what might or could have caused an injury only so\nlong as the facts upon which he bases his opinion are of a type reasonably relied on by experts in\nthe particular field. Iaccino, 406 Ill. App. 3d at 407. In Mesick and Geers, the physicians\u2019\ncausation testimony was based on their examinations of the respective plaintiffs (see Mesick, 141\nIll. App. 3d at 206; Geers, 248 Ill. App. 3d at 408); in Iaccino, the physician\u2019s causation\ntestimony was based on his review of recent placental slides and medical records, which the\nappellate court deemed were sources of information reasonably relied on by pediatric\npathologists to support their medical opinions. Iaccino, 406 Ill. App. 3d at 407. By contrast, in\nthe present case, Dr. Catalano never examined plaintiff nor reviewed any recent medical records\nconcerning her constipation and pain, and thus the trial court committed no abuse of discretion in\nfinding that Dr. Catalano had no reliable basis for his causation opinion, and in barring his\ncausation testimony.\n\u00b6 45 For all the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court.\n\u00b6 46 Affirmed.\n- 15 -",

Connelly, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, Washington, D.C., for\nRespondent.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM:\nDenis Orlando Centeno-Rosales, a native and citizen of El Salvador, petitions for\nreview of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBoard\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from\nthe immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying his applications for asylum, withholding\nof removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We deny the\npetition for review.\nWe conclude that Centeno-Rosales was not denied due process because the IJ found\nthat Centeno-Rosales did not submit his expert\u2019s statement and curriculum vitae on time.\nDue process, in the context of an immigration hearing, requires that aliens be given \u201can\nopportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, i.e., [to] receive\na full and fair hearing on their claims.\u201d Rusu v. INS, 296 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir. 2002).\nTo establish a due process violation during removal proceedings, an alien must show: \u201c(1)\nthat a defect in the proceeding rendered it fundamentally unfair and (2) that the defect\nprejudiced the outcome of the case.\u201d Anim v. Mukasey, 535 F.3d 243, 256 (4th Cir. 2008).\nCenteno-Rosales has not shown that the IJ\u2019s decision to exclude evidence was based on a\ndefect in the proceeding. Centeno-Rosales\u2019 argument that the IJ did not impose a filing\ndeadline was not raised on appeal to the Board. An alien who fails to raise a particular\nclaim before the Board fails to exhaust that claim. See Tiscareno-Garcia v. Holder, 780\nF.3d 205, 210 (4th Cir. 2015). This exhaustion requirement is applied to both \u201cfinal orders\nof removal globally\u201d and \u201cparticular claims specifically.\u201d Shaw v. Sessions, 898 F.3d 448,\n456 (4th Cir. 2018) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).\n2We further conclude that the Board\u2019s finding that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding\nwas not clearly erroneous is support by substantial evidence. Ilunga v. Holder, 777 F.3d\n199, 206 (4th Cir. 2015). The IJ cited specific discrepancies concerning Centeno-Rosales\u2019\nclaim that he was assaulted on two occasions by Salvadoran police because he was\nsuspected of being a gang member. \u201cA single testimonial discrepancy, particularly when\nsupported by other facts in the record, may be sufficient to find an applicant incredible in\nsome circumstances.\u201d Id. at 207. We also conclude that, after reviewing the independent\nevidence, Centeno-Rosales\u2019 status as a suspected gang member and the warrant for his\narrest based on his failure to appear in court for a hearing to address the charge of gang\nmembership does not compel a finding that he will be persecuted on account of a protected\nground.\nLastly, while the agency gave short shrift to Centeno-Rosales\u2019 independent evidence\nin denying his eligibility for protection under the CAT, we conclude that substantial\nevidence supports the finding that Centeno-Rosales failed to show that the Salvadoran\ngovernment intended to torture him. See Oxygene v. Lynch, 813 F.3d 541, 550 (4th Cir.\n2016) (adopting intent standard for CAT claims as announced in In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec.\n291 (B.I.A. 2002)).\nAccordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument\nbecause the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this\ncourt and argument would not aid the decisional process.\nPETITION DENIED\n3",

Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b).1 On the basis of that\nconviction, the Government charged Nouledo with removability for, inter alia, having\nbeen convicted of a \u201ccrime of child abuse\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The\nImmigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) sustained the charge.\nNouledo applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\nConvention Against Torture. His testimony in support of his applications was not\nentirely clear. In general, however, he claimed to fear persecution and torture in Togo on\naccount of his political beliefs. In particular, he claimed that he participated in a coup in\nTogo in 2005 and that authorities detained and tortured him for five days as a result until\nhe fled to Benin, where he lived before coming to the United States.\nThe IJ denied Nouledo\u2019s applications. The IJ concluded that Nouledo failed to\ncorroborate his claim of having been persecuted and tortured in the past but that, even if\n1 Subsection (a) defines the crime of indecent exposure, and subsection (b) is a grading\nprovision that makes indecent exposure a first-degree misdemeanor only if the victim was\nless than 16 years old. Nouledo\u2019s record of conviction shows that he pleaded guilty to\nand was sentenced for a first-degree misdemeanor under this statute. (A.252-53, 255.)\n2he had, the Government met its burden to show changed circumstances in Togo because\nthe incident occurred 12 years ago and the 2016 country report states that there were no\nreports of political prisoners or detainees or of governmental torture. For the same\nreason, the IJ concluded that Nouledo failed to show that he had a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution or that he likely faced persecution or torture in the future. Thus, the IJ\nordered Nouledo\u2019s removal to Benin and, in the alternative, to Togo.\nNouledo appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which dismissed\nhis appeal on the merits essentially for the reasons given by the IJ. Nouledo now\npetitions for review.2\nII.\nOn review, Nouledo has not raised any specific challenge to any of the BIA\u2019s\nrulings and the arguments that he does raise are largely inapposite. Nevertheless, we will\nliberally construe his pro se brief as raising three issues. Each lacks merit.\nFirst, Nouledo challenges the BIA\u2019s ruling that his criminal conviction renders\nhim removable. The BIA, however, properly concluded that Nouledo\u2019s conviction of\nindecent exposure to a person less than 16 years old in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\n3127(a) and (b) constitutes a removable \u201ccrime of child abuse\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n2 The Government removed Nouledo to Togo while this petition was pending, but his\nremoval does not render it moot. See Pieschacon-Villegas v. Att\u2019y Gen., 671 F.3d 303,\n309 n.5 (3d Cir. 2011). Thus, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We\nreview factual determinations for substantial evidence and will not disturb them unless\nthe evidence compels a contrary conclusion. See Uddin v. Att\u2019y Gen., 870 F.3d 282, 289\n(3d Cir. 2017). We review legal issues de novo. See id.\n31227(a)(2)(E)(i). The BIA has broadly defined a crime of child abuse to include \u201c[a]ny\noffense involving an intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act or\nomission that constitutes maltreatment of a child or that impairs a child\u2019s physical or\nmental well-being.\u201d In re Velazquez-Herrera, 24 I. & N. Dec. 503, 512 (BIA 2008).\nThis Court has recognized that the phrase child abuse \u201cis meant to address conduct that is\ncriminal,\u201d and therefore has found it \u201cappropriate to define the phrase \u2018child abuse\u2019 under\nthe INA to capture conduct that poses a particular likelihood of harm to the child.\u201d Zhi\nFei Liao v. Att\u2019y Gen., 910 F.3d 714, 721 (3d Cir. 2018).\nA conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b) categorically qualifies.\nUnder that statute, \u201c[a] person commits indecent exposure if that person exposes his or\nher genitals in any public place or in any place where there are present other persons\nunder circumstances in which he or she knows or should know that this conduct is likely\nto offend, affront or alarm.\u201d 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a). Exposing one\u2019s genitals to a\nchild under such circumstances undoubtedly \u201cimpairs a child\u2019s . . . mental well-being.\u201d\nMondragon-Gonzalez, 884 F.3d at 158-59. And a conviction for doing so satisfies the\nBIA\u2019s mens rea requirement because such a conviction requires at least criminal\nnegligence. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 302(a), (b)(4); see also 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 302, Jt.\nSt. Govt. Comm. Comment\u20141967 (\u201c\u2018Negligently,\u2019 as used in Subsection (b)(4), is\nintended to mean criminal negligence.\u201d).\nSecond, Nouledo challenges the denial of his applications for relief. The BIA\u2019s\nrulings on those applications, however, is supported by substantial evidence. Nouledo\n4claims to fear persecution and torture in Togo on the basis of his political activities there\nover 12 years ago. The BIA concluded that the record did not support his claim, and our\nreview of the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. In particular, the 2016\nHuman Rights Report for Togo states that \u201c[t]here were no reports the government or its\nagents committed arbitrary or unlawful killing\u201d (A.272), \u201c[t]here were no reports of\npolitically motivated disappearances\u201d (id.), \u201cthere were no reports that government\nofficials employed [torture]\u201d (A.273), and \u201c[t]here were no reports of political prisoners\nor detainees\u201d (A.277).\nFinally, Nouledo argues that various equitable factors, such as his family ties to\nthe United States, weigh against removal. As the BIA explained, however, Nouledo was\nnot eligible for any relief on the basis of such considerations. In particular, Nouledo was\nnot eligible for a hardship-based waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (Immigration and\nNationality Act \u00a7 212(h)) because that section does not permit the waiver of removability\nunder 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2). Nouledo also did not\nargue before the Agency and has not argued before us that he was eligible for\ncancellation of removal. He was not because he had not accrued seven years of\ncontinuous residence following his admission. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(2).\nIII.\nFor these reasons, we will deny Nouledo\u2019s petition for review.\n5",

See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), (d)(1). The\n1A \u201ccommunication facility\u201d is defined as \u201cany and all public and private\ninstrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals,district court2 sentenced him to 46 months in prison. On appeal, Goldsmith\nchallenges the denial of a pretrial suppression motion and argues that his sentence is\nsubstantively unreasonable. We affirm.\nGoldsmith did not properly preserve the first of his two challenges. Guilty\npleas are \u201cpresumptively unconditional\u201d and waive any \u201cnon-jurisdictional defects\nand defenses\u201d to a conviction. United States v. Limley, 510 F.3d 825, 827 (8th Cir.\n2007). There is an exception: a criminal defendant can, \u201c[w]ith the consent of the\ncourt and the government, . . . reserv[e]\u201d the right to appeal the denial of a \u201cspecified\npretrial motion\u201d in \u201cwriting.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). But this case does not fall\nwithin it.\nGoldsmith has a written plea agreement, but it is missing any reference to his\nsuppression motion. Rather, in a section of the agreement containing the heading,\n\u201cSENTENCING PROVISIONS,\u201d it says only that\n[t]he parties are free to contest or defend any ruling of the Court, unless\notherwise limited by this agreement, on appeal or in any other post-\nconviction proceeding.\nReserving \u201cany ruling\u201d without \u201cspecif[ying]\u201d a single one is the opposite of what\nRule 11(a)(2) demands, which is precise identification of \u201cwhat pretrial issues have\nbeen preserved for appellate review.\u201d Limley, 510 F.3d at 827\u201328 (quoting Fed. R.\nCrim. P. 11(a) advisory committee\u2019s note to 1983 amendment) (holding that a guilty\nplea was unconditional even though the plea agreement stated that the defendant\n\u201cretain[ed] all rights to appeal\u201d his conviction). Because \u201c[n]othing [else] in the\nrecord\u201d satisfies Rule 11(a)(2)\u2019s specificity requirement, Goldsmith has waived his\nright to appeal the denial of the motion. Id. at 828.\npictures, or sounds of all kinds.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). Included within this definition\nare \u201cmail, telephone, wire, radio, and all other means of communication.\u201d Id.\n2The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern\nDistrict of Iowa.\n- 2 -Even though Goldsmith retained the right to appeal the length of his sentence,\nthere is nothing unreasonable about it. See United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455,\n461 (8th Cir. 2009) (en banc) (explaining that we review the substantive\nreasonableness of a sentence for an abuse of discretion). The district court\nsufficiently considered the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), before\nimposing a bottom-of-the-Guidelines-range sentence of 46 months in prison. See\nUnited States v. Washington, 893 F.3d 1076, 1080\u201381 (8th Cir. 2018) (explaining\nthat a sentence within the Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable). Although\nGoldsmith argues that the court failed to adequately consider several mitigating\nfactors, the court simply gave them less weight than he would have liked. This was\nwithin its discretion to do. See United States v. Nguyen, 829 F.3d 907, 925\u201326 (8th\nCir. 2016) (acknowledging the \u201cwide latitude\u201d that district courts have in this area).\nWe accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.\n______________________________\n- 3 -",

For the reasons below, we affirm.\nThe facts and procedural history underlying this appeal are well-known\nto the parties, and summarized in a prior decision of this Court. See\nCommonwealth v. Walker, 816 WDA 2012 (unpub. memo. at 1-3) (Pa.\nSuper. Jan. 18, 2013), appeal denied, 69 A.3d 243 (Pa. 2013). Accordingly,\nwe need not reiterate them in detail herein. In summary, on February 5,\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.J-S03027-20\n1991, Appellant was found guilty by a jury on charges of second-degree\nmurder, robbery and criminal conspiracy2 for the 1983 death of a jitney driver.\nThe trial court granted Appellant\u2019s request to arrest judgment on the robbery\nand conspiracy convictions. Thereafter, on March 2, 1991, the trial court\nsentenced Appellant to a term of life imprisonment for his conviction of\nsecond-degree murder. A panel of this Court affirmed the judgment of\nsentence on direct appeal, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied\nAppellant\u2019s petition for review. Commonwealth v. Walker, 610 PGH 1991\n(unpub. memo.) (Pa. Super. Jun. 26, 1992), appeal denied, 633 A.2d 151 (Pa.\n1993).\nAppellant filed his first PCRA petition, pro se, on February 24, 1994.\nCounsel was appointed, and filed both an amended and supplemental\namended petition. Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCRA court denied\nAppellant relief. On appeal, this Court affirmed, and the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court denied review. Commonwealth v. Walker, 2393 PGH 1997\n(unpub. memo.) (Pa. Super. Mar. 23, 1999), appeal denied, 740 A.2d 1147\n(Pa. 1999).\nAppellant filed a second PCRA petition on November 2, 2002, which the\nPCRA court dismissed as untimely, and this Court affirmed on appeal.\nCommonwealth v. Walker, 630 WDA 2005 (unpub.memo.) (Pa. Super. Jan.\n26, 2006). He filed another petition on January 6, 2010, which the PCRA court\n2 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(b), 3701(a)(1), and 903, respectively.\n- 2 -J-S03027-20\nagain dismissed as untimely. Appellant\u2019s appeal to this Court was dismissed\non October 22, 2010, when he failed to filed a brief. Subsequently, on April\n4, 2012, Appellant filed a petition for writ of coram nobis. The trial court\nconstrued the filing to be another PCRA petition, and dismissed it as untimely\non May 4, 2012. Once again, this Court affirmed the ruling on appeal and the\nPennsylvania Supreme Court denied review. Commonwealth v. Walker,\n816 WDA 2012 (unpub. memo. at 1-3) (Pa. Super. Jan. 18, 2013), appeal\ndenied, 69 A.3d 243 (Pa. 2013).\nAppellant filed the present PCRA petition, his fifth, on April 4, 2019. On\nMay 8, 2019, the PCRA court provided Appellant with notice of its intent to\ndismiss the petition without first conducting an evidentiary hearing pursuant\nto Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Thereafter, the court dismissed the petition by order\nfiled May 29, 2019. Appellant filed a response to the PCRA court\u2019s Rule 907\nnotice, but it was not received by the court until May 30, 2019. This timely\nappeal followed.3\nAppellant raises three issues on appeal. First, he contends the PCRA\ncourt erred when it dismissed his petition without first appointing counsel or\nconsidering his pro se response to the court\u2019s Rule 907 notice. Appellant\u2019s\nBrief at 3. Second, Appellant argues the court erred when it dismissed his\npetition without addressing his claim that trial counsel conceded his guilt to\n3 Although not ordered to do so by the PCRA court, Appellant filed a Pa.R.A.P.\n1925(b) concise statement of errors complained of on appeal on August 12,\n2019.\n- 3 -J-S03027-20\nthe jury during closing arguments. Id. Third, he asserts the PCRA court erred\nwhen it dismissed his petition as untimely after he demonstrated an exception\nto the timeliness requirements, namely, the \u201ccity detective\u2019s use of \u2018the Reid\nTrain[ing]\u2019 that is know[n] for causing false confessions.\u201d Id. at 4.\nOur standard of review of an order denying PCRA relief is well-\nestablished. \u201c[W]e examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination \u2018is\nsupported by the record and free of legal error.\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v.\nMitchell, 141 A.3d 1277, 1283\u201384 (Pa. 2016) (citation omitted).\nFurthermore,\na petitioner is not entitled to a PCRA hearing as a matter of right;\nthe PCRA court can decline to hold a hearing if there is no genuine\nissue concerning any material fact, the petitioner is not entitled to\nPCRA relief, and no purpose would be served by any further\nproceedings.\nCommonwealth v. Shaw, 217 A.3d 265, 269 (Pa. Super. 2019).\nIn his first issue, Appellant asserts the PCRA court erred in dismissing\nhis petition without appointing counsel or considering his response to the\ncourt\u2019s Rule 907 notice. Preliminarily, we note that pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P.\n904(C), an indigent petitioner is entitled to the appointment of counsel to\nassist him in litigating his first PCRA petition. Pa.R.Crim.P. 904(C). As noted\nabove, this is Appellant\u2019s fifth request for post-conviction relief. Nevertheless,\nRule 904(D) and (E) permit a PCRA court to appoint counsel to an indigent\npetitioner filing a second or subsequent petition when either \u201can evidentiary\nhearing is required\u201d or \u201cthe interests of justice require it.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P.\n904(D), (E). Because, as we will discuss infra, we conclude Appellant\u2019s\n- 4 -J-S03027-20\npetition was untimely filed, and thus no evidentiary hearing was required, we\ndetect no error in the PCRA court\u2019s refusal to appoint counsel. Moreover, to\nthe extent Appellant complains the PCRA court dismissed his petition without\nfirst considering his response to the court\u2019s Rule 907 notice, no relief is\nwarranted. Although it does appear Appellant\u2019s response was timely filed\npursuant to the prisoner mailbox rule,4 his objections to the court\u2019s order are\naptly raised in his brief on appeal. Accordingly, Appellant is entitled to no\nrelief on his first claim.\nAppellant\u2019s remaining two issues involve his claims that (1) trial counsel\nadmitted to the jury during closing arguments that Appellant was guilty of\nrobbery; and (2) the detectives who took his statement obtained a false\nconfession from him by employing a recently debunked interrogation\nprocedure. However, before we address any substantive claims, we must first\ndetermine if Appellant\u2019s petition was timely filed.\nThe statutory requirement that a PCRA petition be filed within one year\nof the date the judgment of sentence becomes final is both \u201cmandatory and\njurisdictional in nature[,]\u201d and a PCRA court may not ignore the untimeliness\nof a petition to address the merits of the issues raised therein.\n4 The 20-day period for filing a response to the court\u2019s Rule 907 notice expired\non May 28, 2019; Appellant\u2019s response was not time-stamped until May 30,\n2019. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 907(1) (permitting defendant to respond to court\u2019s\nRule 907 notice within 20 days). However, \u201c[p]ursuant to the \u2018prisoner\nmailbox rule,\u2019 a document is deemed filed when placed in the hands of prison\nauthorities for mailing.\u201d Commonwealth v. Wilson, 911 A.2d 942, 944 n.2\n(Pa. Super. 2006). Accordingly, we consider Appellant\u2019s response to have\nbeen timely filed.\n- 5 -J-S03027-20\nCommonwealth v. Taylor, 67 A.3d 1245, 1248 (Pa. 2013). See also 42\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). Here, it is undisputed Appellant\u2019s petition was untimely\nfiled. As a panel of this Court found in a prior appeal,\nAppellant\u2019s judgment of sentence became final on or about\nNovember 29, 1993, when the sixty-day time period for filing a\nwrit of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court\nexpired. See former U.S.Sup.Ct.R. 20; 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n9545(b)(3). Therefore, Appellant had to file this PCRA petition by\nNovember 29, 1994, in order for it to be timely.\nWalker, 816 WDA 2012 (unpub. memo. at 5). The present petition, filed on\nApril 4, 2019, is manifestly untimely.\nNevertheless, an untimely petition may be considered if one of the three\ntimeliness exceptions applies. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).5 A\n5 The PCRA provides, in relevant part:\nAny petition under this subchapter, including a second or\nsubsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the\njudgment becomes final, unless the petition alleges and the\npetitioner proves that:\n(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of\ninterference by government officials with the presentation of\nthe claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this\nCommonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United\nStates;\n(ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were\nunknown to the petitioner and could not have been\nascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n(iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was\nrecognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the\nSupreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period\nprovided in this section and has been held by that court to\napply retroactively.\n- 6 -J-S03027-20\npetition invoking one of the exceptions must be filed \u201cwithin one year of the\ndate the claim could have been presented.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\nFirst, Appellant maintains he suffered a \u201cgross stru[ctur]al constitutional\nerror\u201d when trial counsel admitted to the jury that Appellant was guilty of\nrobbery. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. Relying upon the United States Supreme\nCourt\u2019s recent decision in McCoy v. Louisiana, 138 S.Ct. 1500 (2018),\nAppellant argues trial counsel may not concede his client\u2019s guilt. Appellant\u2019s\nBrief at 22. Appellant insists he is entitled to PCRA relief because he filed his\npetition within one year of the McCoy decision, which Appellant maintains\nconstituted a newly discovered fact pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(ii), or a\nnewly recognized constitutional right pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(iii). We\ndisagree.\nIn McCoy, the United States Supreme Court concluded trial counsel was\nineffective when, in an effort to spare his client the death penalty, he admitted\nto the jury the defendant committed the murders, despite the defendant\u2019s\nadamant objection to any admission of guilt. McCoy, 158 S.Ct. at 1505.\nFurther, the Court held \u201ccounsel\u2019s admission of a client\u2019s guilt over the client\u2019s\nexpress objection is error structural in kind,\u201d for which the defendant is\nentitled to a new trial without having to show prejudice. Id. at 1511.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(i)-(iii).\n- 7 -J-S03027-20\nAppellant argues McCoy is applicable to the facts of his case because\ntrial counsel told the jury during closing arguments that \u201caccording to\n[Appellant\u2019s] statement\u201d to police, Appellant took the victim\u2019s pocketknife.\nN.T., 1/31/91, at 461. Therefore, if the jury found that statement \u201cto be\nvoluntary . . . the Commonwealth has proven the crime of robbery.\u201d Id. at\n465. However, Appellant fails to acknowledge that counsel also argued\nAppellant\u2019s statement was involuntary. See id. at 467-75. In the event the\njury did not agree, counsel urged it to find that, at most, Appellant\u2019s statement\nestablished he committed robbery, but not conspiracy or murder.\nEven assuming, arguendo, that McCoy applies to the facts here,\nAppellant is unable to establish one of the PCRA timeliness exceptions. To the\nextent he maintains the McCoy decision involves a newly recognized\nconstitutional right, we note that the PCRA requires the petitioner to prove the\nnewly established right \u201chas been held by that court to apply retroactively.\u201d\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(iii). To date, the United States Supreme Court has\nnot held the McCoy decision is to apply retroactively. Additionally, with regard\nto the newly discovered facts exception, it is well-settled that \u201csubsequent\ndecisional law does not amount to a new \u2018fact\u2019 under section 9545(b)(1)(ii) of\nthe PCRA.\u201d Commonwealth v. Watts, 23 A.3d 980, 987 (Pa. 2011).\nAccordingly, Appellant has not established a timeliness exception based upon\nMcCoy.\nLastly, Appellant contends he is entitled to relief based upon a May 2018\narticle denouncing the \u201cReid Technique\u201d of police interrogation because it\n- 8 -J-S03027-20\nleads to false confessions. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 27. He attached a copy of the\narticle to his PCRA petition. See Appellant\u2019s Motion for Post Conviction\nCollateral Relief, 4/4/19, attachment. Appellant maintains the detectives who\ntook his statement used their \u201cReid Technique\u201d training to obtain \u201cfalse\nstatements and confessions\u201d from him. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29.\nIn order to obtain relief under the newly discovered facts exception, a\npetitioner must plead and prove \u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated\nwere unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the\nexercise of due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii). Although the May\n2018 article criticizing the \u201cReid Technique\u201d was published within one year of\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA petition, the facts upon which Appellant\u2019s claim is predicated\n\u2013 i.e., the detectives who interviewed him employed questionable techniques6\n\u2013 were not unknown to him. Indeed, on direct appeal, Appellant challenged\nthe trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial suppression motion. See Walker, 610\nPGH 1992 (unpub. memo. at 6-9) (arguing, inter alia, his confession was\ncoerced when police pointed gun to his head). Moreover, we note the 2018\narticle explained the \u201cReid Technique\u201d was a controversial form of\ninterrogation for many years, and was even cited in Miranda v. Arizona, 384\nU.S. 436 (1966), \u201cas a reason suspects must be admonished of their right\nagainst self-incrimination.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Motion for Post Conviction\n6 Appellant does not identify any purported improper techniques employed by\nthe detectives during his interview, except for a vague reference to his belief\nthat he was formally under arrest when he was provided with his Miranda\nwarnings. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 37.\n- 9 -J-S03027-20\nCollateral Relief, 4/4/19, attachment, \u201cControversial Police Interrogation\nTechnique That Often Results in False Confessions Abandoned by Influential\nTraining Consultant,\u201d Criminal Legal News, May 2018. Accordingly, Appellant\ncannot establish the facts underlying this claim were unknown to him or could\nnot have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence. Therefore, no\nrelief is warranted.\nBecause we agree with the decision of the PCRA court that Appellant\u2019s\nPCRA petition was untimely filed, and Appellant failed to prove the applicability\nof any of the timing exceptions set forth in Section 9545(b)(1), we affirm the\norder denying PCRA relief.7\nOrder affirmed.\nJudge Pellegrini joins this memorandum.\nJudge McLaughlin concurs in the result.\n7 We note that Appellant discusses a number of other claims in his rambling,\npro se brief. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29 (there was no probable cause for his\ndetention); 30-31 (his taped statement to police did not support charges filed\nagainst him); 36 (Commonwealth\u2019s plea offer was a nullity because the\ncharges of robbery and conspiracy were outside the statute of limitations).\nBecause they were not raised in his PCRA petition, we do not address them.\nSee Commonwealth v. Mason, 130 A.3d 601, 639 (Pa. 2015) (issues not\nincluded in PCRA petition or court-approved amendment are waived).\n- 10 -J-S03027-20\nJudgment Entered.\nJoseph D.

The district court1 sentenced him to 120\n1The Honorable John A. Jarvey, Chief Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Southern District of Iowa.months\u2019 imprisonment and eight years of supervised release. Less than a year after\nrelease, he violated the conditions of supervised release. The court revoked his\nsupervision and sentenced him to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment and 60 months of\nsupervised release. Ruiz appealed, and this court affirmed. Upon release, he again\nviolated the conditions of supervised release. The court revoked his supervision and\nsentenced him to 8 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months of supervised release. He\nappeals. Having jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court affirms.\nRuiz contends the district court erred in revoking his supervised release. \u201cA\ndistrict court may revoke supervised release if the government proves by a\npreponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised\nrelease.\u201d United States v. Petersen, 848 F.3d 1153, 1156 (8th Cir. 2017) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). This court reviews the decision to revoke supervised\nrelease for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Frosch, 758 F.3d 1012, 1014 (8th\nCir. 2014).\nRuiz admitted violating two conditions of release: failure to comply with\nsubstance abuse treatment and failure to report to the probation office. He argues the\ndistrict court abused its discretion in revoking his supervision based on these\n\u201ctechnical\u201d Grade C violations. The district court may revoke supervised release\nbased on Grade C violations. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(a)(2) (\u201cUpon a finding of a Grade\nC violation, the court may (A) revoke probation or supervised release; or (B) extend\nthe term of probation or supervised release and/or modify the conditions of\nsupervision.\u201d); United States v. Melton, 666 F.3d 513, 516 (8th Cir. 2012) (rejecting\nargument that Grade C violations were \u201cmerely technical\u201d).\nRevoking Ruiz\u2019s supervised release and imposing a within-guidelines sentence,\nthe district court said:\n-2-In fashioning an appropriate sentence, I have considered each of the\nfactors found in Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(a), factors\nin 3583(e), Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines has policy\nstatements. I have considered the history and the persistent problems,\nlargely based on attitude. I have considered how long he has been on\nand the fact that we are not having much success.\nI will terminate the supervised release, but I don\u2019t want to reward him\nfor the behaviors thus far. I am very concerned when he comes back we\nare just going to have to revoke him again. I hope that is not true.\nThese are grade C violations. He\u2019s a Criminal History Category IV at the\ntime of his last sentencing. I conclude that the following sentence is\nsufficient, but not greater than necessary, to address the essential\nsentencing considerations.\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking his supervision.\n* * * * * * *\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n______________________________\n-3-",

    "text": "IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI\nNO. 2018-CP-00970-COA\nDON R. LEWIS A/K/A DON LEWIS A/K/A DON APPELLANT\nRUSSELL LEWIS\nv.\nSTATE OF MISSISSIPPI APPELLEE\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 06/06/2018\nTRIAL JUDGE: HON. ANTHONY ALAN MOZINGO\nCOURT FROM WHICH APPEALED: PEARL RIVER COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLANT: DON R. LEWIS (PRO SE)\nATTORNEY FOR APPELLEE: OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL\nBY: BARBARA WAKELAND BYRD\nNATURE OF THE CASE: CIVIL - POST-CONVICTION RELIEF\nDISPOSITION: REVERSED AND REMANDED - 02/11/2020\nMOTION FOR REHEARING FILED:\nMANDATE ISSUED:\nBEFORE CARLTON, P.J., WESTBROOKS AND McCARTY, JJ.\nWESTBROOKS, J., FOR THE COURT:\n\u00b61. Don Lewis pleaded guilty to fondling a child and was sentenced to fifteen years in the\ncustody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with four years to serve and\neleven years of post-release supervision (PRS). It was later alleged that Lewis had violated\nthe terms of his PRS. The Pearl River County Circuit Court held a revocation hearing and\nrevoked Lewis\u2019s PRS. Lewis filed a motion for post-conviction relief (PCR), claiming his\nprobation was unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s motion. Aggrieved,\nLewis appeals. After reviewing the record, we reverse and remand to the circuit court for an\nevidentiary hearing.FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\u00b62. In 2007, Lewis was indicted for and pleaded guilty to the fondling of a child in\nviolation of Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23(1) (Supp. 1998). He was sentenced\nto fifteen years in the MDOC\u2019s custody, with four years to serve and eleven years of PRS.\nLewis was also ordered to pay a $1,500.00 fine and $654.00 in restitution. In May 2015, an\nMDOC supervising officer alleged that Lewis violated the terms of his PRS by being arrested\nonce for simple-assault domestic violence and twice for DUI, as well as for failing to pay his\nfines. The circuit court held a revocation hearing.\n\u00b63. At the revocation hearing, Lewis admitted to the arrests. No further testimony was\nprovided concerning them, and the record includes no other information about them.\nRegarding the fines, the record is equally unclear. At the close of the hearing, the circuit\ncourt found Lewis \u201cguilty,\u201d revoked his PRS, and reinstated the seven-year and five-month\nbalance of his sentence. On March 28, 2018, Lewis filed a PCR motion claiming that his\nprobation had been unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s PCR motion on\nJune 5, 2018. Lewis filed his notice of appeal on July 2, 2018.\n\u00b64. Lewis raises five issues on appeal, but they can be properly addressed with two\nquestions. First, did the circuit court err by improperly applying the provisions of Mississippi\nCode Annotated section 47-7-37 (Supp. 2014)? Second, did the circuit court err by revoking\nLewis\u2019s PRS?\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\n\u00b65. This Court reviews the denial of a PCR motion under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\n2Brown v. State, 864 So. 2d 1058, 1059 (\u00b67) (Miss. Ct. App. 2004) (citing McClinton v. State,\n799 So. 2d 123, 126 (\u00b64) (Miss. Ct. App. 2001)). A trial court\u2019s denial of a PCR motion will\nnot be reversed \u201cabsent a finding that the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.\u201d Stokes\nv. State, 199 So. 3d 745, 748 (\u00b67) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016) (citing Wilson v. State, 76 So. 3d\n733, 735 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011)). This Court reviews issues of law de novo. Id.\nDISCUSSION OF ISSUES AND ANALYSIS\nI. Section 47-7-37\n\u00b66. Lewis argues that he should benefit from the 2018 amendment to section 47-7-37. The\namendments changed the focus in revocations to the number of prior revocations, rather than\nthe number of technical violations. For Lewis to benefit,1 the amendment would have to be\napplied retroactively to his revocation hearing in June 2015. Mississippi Code Annotated\nsection 99-19-1 (Rev. 2015) provides as follows:\nNo statutory change of any law affecting a crime or its punishment or the\ncollection of a penalty shall affect or defeat the prosecution of any crime\ncommitted prior to its enactment, or the collection of any penalty, whether\nsuch prosecution be instituted before or after such enactment; and all laws\ndefining a crime or prescribing its punishment, or for the imposition of\npenalties, shall be continued in operation for the purpose of providing\npunishment for crimes committed under them, and for collection of such\npenalties, notwithstanding amendatory or repealing statutes, unless otherwise\nspecifically provided in such statutes.\nOur Supreme Court has held that \u201call laws prescribing punishment for a crime remain in\neffect for the purpose of ascribing punishment \u2018unless otherwise specially provided\u2019 in a\n1 There is not sufficient information in the record to determine if Lewis would benefit\nat all from a retroactive application of the 2018 amendment. Such a determination is not\nrequired of this Court because Lewis\u2019s second issue is dispositive concerning his appeal.\n3newly enacted statute.\u201d Wilson v. State, 194 So. 3d 855, 867 (\u00b642) (Miss. 2016) (quoting\n\u00a7 99-19-1). When the subject statute was amended by the Legislature, it did not express that\nthe amendment should be retroactively applied. Lewis\u2019s contention that the amendment\nshould apply in his case is without merit.\nII. Revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS Due to Arrests\n\u00b67. Lewis next argues the circuit court erred by revoking his PRS after adjudicating him\n\u201cguilty\u201d of multiple offenses and violations without sufficient evidence. In its \u201cOrder\nDenying Motion for Post-Conviction Collateral Relief,\u201d the circuit court stated that \u201c[t]he\ndefendant\u2019s own admission is a sufficient basis to find he violated the terms of his PRS.\u201d The\ncircuit court\u2019s order also states that Lewis admitted \u201che had not paid his fees and fines as\nordered.\u201d The record is unclear as to whether such a statement concerning Lewis\u2019s fines is\naccurate. Lewis contends he paid the fines in full with the financial assistance of his mother.\nThere was no evidence or testimony to support any allegation that Lewis had not paid his\nfines. Lewis provided the only testimony at his revocation hearing. No further evidence or\ndetails concerning the arrests were provided. The sole foundation for the revocation of\nLewis\u2019s PRS was his admission that he was arrested three times while on PRS and the circuit\ncourt\u2019s apparent issue concerning Lewis\u2019s fines.\n\u00b68. This Court has stated that the \u201cmere arrest of a probationer is not a violation of\nprobation.\u201d Brown v. State, 864 So. 2d 1058, 1060 (\u00b69) (Miss. Ct. App. 2004). This Court\nhas more specifically held that when alleged criminal activity is the basis for revocation, the\nState \u201cmust show proof of an actual conviction, or that a crime has been committed and that\n4it is more likely than not that the probationer committed the offense.\u201d Id. A review of the\ncircuit court\u2019s order demonstrates that the circuit court did not meet that standard.\n\u00b69. The instant case is factually similar to Brown in that the only basis for the revocation\nof Lewis\u2019s PRS is his own admission that he was arrested. The circuit court did not conduct\nany evidentiary inquiries of Lewis or anyone else. After Lewis admitted to being arrested,\nthe circuit judge asked the following question, \u201cYou, also, had a guilty conviction on drug\ncharges in 1993. And by your own admission, your mother\u2019s check is paying your fees and\nfines and she\u2019s having to keep you in compliance with probation. I have one question for you.\nWhat good are you to anybody?\u201d Lewis attempted to explain and answer the question\nconcerning the fines by stating he had lost his job. The circuit judge asked no further\nquestions but instead stated the following, \u201cIt seems to me, if you want to know my honest\nopinion, your mother would be a lot better off with you in the penitentiary. Your probation\nis revoked. That way, she doesn\u2019t have to pay your fees and fines.\u201d The circuit court failed\nto reference any evidentiary or factual basis for revoking Lewis\u2019s PRS because of the status\nof his fines. In fact, the only information contained in the transcript, as evidenced by the\nexchange between the circuit judge and Lewis, arguably demonstrates that the fines were\ncurrent. The only facts that the circuit judge managed to articulate was that Lewis\u2019s mother\nhad been helping him pay the fines after he had lost his job. Lewis attempted to advise the\ncircuit court that his mother would not be responsible for his fines any longer, but the circuit\njudge stopped him and eventually concluded the proceeding with the following statement:\nAnd you need to be able to get out and keep up with that and everything else\nand doctors suggesting surgery. What I heard from you in that letter is nothing\n5is your fault, never has been your fault, everything just came upon you. And\nhad you gotten up and accepted responsibility for being a drain on your poor\nold sick mother, I might have had a different attitude.\nYou\u2019re adjudicated guilty. Your probation is revoked and you\u2019re sentenced to\nserve the remainder of the term left on probation, this being two felony\nconvictions and now a revocation, I would give you the full 15 years. So\nyou\u2019re very fortunate that I could only give you seven years and five months.\nYou\u2019re dismissed.\nThe circuit court made no attempt to base the revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS within the\nappropriate standard. In fact, the record contains no information regarding the arrests and\nfines other than what Lewis provided. There was no finding, or even an attempted finding,\nthat it was more likely than not that Lewis committed any of the three offenses referenced\nin the trial court proceedings.\n\u00b610. Lewis may well have committed all three of the offenses referenced in the revocation\npetition, but the circuit court committed error by revoking Lewis\u2019s PRS on the scant\ninformation that was advanced at the revocation hearing. Mere arrest cannot be the basis for\nprobation revocation. There was no basis to find that it was more likely than not that Lewis\nhad committed any of the offenses listed in the revocation petition.2\n\u00b611. Finding this failure to be error, we reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment and remand\nthis case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\u00b612. REVERSED AND REMANDED.\nBARNES, C.J., CARLTON AND J. WILSON, P.JJ., GREENLEE, TINDELL,\n2 In its brief, the State concedes that \u201c[t]he record in this case is insufficient to support\nthe trial court\u2019s decision to revoke Lewis\u2019[s] probation.\u201d The State also says, \u201c[T]hough it\nis probable that Lewis did commit subsequent crimes and, therefore, violated the terms of\nhis probation, mere arrest cannot be the basis for a probation revocation.\u201d\n6McDONALD, LAWRENCE, McCARTY AND C.

Hunt, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral; Anthony P. Nicastro,\nAssistant Director; Sherease Pratt,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, United\nStates Department of Justice,\nWashington, DC.UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision, it is hereby\nORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review is\nDENIED.\nPetitioner Xing Wang Lin, a native and citizen of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of a November 21, 2017,\ndecision of the BIA affirming a March 22, 2017, decision of an\nImmigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying him asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and relief under the Convention Against Torture\n(\u201cCAT\u201d). In re Xing Wang Lin, No. A206 735 092 (B.I.A. Nov.\n21, 2017), aff\u2019g No. A206 735 092 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar.\n22, 2017). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the\nunderlying facts and procedural history.\nWe have reviewed both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor\nthe sake of completeness.\u201d Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland\nSec., 448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable\nstandards of review are well established. See 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); Y.C. v. Holder, 741 F.3d 324, 332 (2d Cir.\n2013). The agency did not err in concluding that Lin failed\nto satisfy his burden of proving past persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of future persecution on account of his\nattendance at a church service that police raided in 2014 and\nhis continued religious practice.\n2A valid past persecution claim can be based on harm other\nthan threats to life or freedom, including\n\u201cnon-life-threatening violence and physical abuse,\u201d Beskovic\nv. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 223, 226 n.3 (2d Cir. 2006), but the harm\nmust rise above \u201cmere harassment,\u201d Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t\nof Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006). Because Lin did\nnot have any interaction with police during the raid on his\nchurch and he did not suffer harm in China, he did not suffer\npast persecution. See id.; see also Mei Fun Wong v. Holder,\n633 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cWe have emphasized that\npersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every\nsort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\nAbsent past persecution, an alien may establish\neligibility for asylum by demonstrating a well-founded fear of\nfuture persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2); Ramsameachire\nv. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir. 2004). To demonstrate\na well-founded fear, an applicant must show either a reasonable\npossibility that he would be singled out for persecution or that\nthe country of removal has a pattern or practice of persecuting\nsimilarly situated individuals. 8 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii). The agency reasonably found that Lin\nfailed to establish an objectively reasonable fear of\n3persecution on account of his religious practice because his\nclaim that he would be singled out for persecution was\nspeculative and his evidence did not demonstrate a pattern or\npractice of persecution of similarly situated Christians.\nLin\u2019s claim that he would be singled out for persecution\nbased on the raid on his church was speculative given his\ntestimony that police had not looked for him since 2014 and that\nhis church may no longer be open. See Jian Xing Huang v. INS,\n421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201cIn the absence of solid\nsupport in the record . . . , [an applicant\u2019s] fear is\nspeculative at best.\u201d). And the country conditions evidence\ndid not establish a pattern or practice of persecution of\nsimilarly situated Christians in China because it indicates\nthat tens of millions of Christians practice in unregistered\nchurches in China and that officials do not interfere with\nreligious practice in some areas of the country. See 8 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(iii); see also Santoso v. Holder, 580 F.3d 110,\n112 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2009); In re A-M-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 737, 741\n(B.I.A. 2005) (recognizing that a pattern or practice of\npersecution is the \u201csystemic or pervasive\u201d persecution of a\ngroup).\nBecause Lin failed to establish past persecution or a\nwell-founded fear of future persecution, the agency did not err\n4in denying asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief\nbecause all three claims were based on the same factual\npredicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.\n2006).*\nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\nDENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal\nthat the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED,\nand any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition\nis DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument\nin this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of\nAppellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule\n34.1(b).\nFOR THE COURT:\nCatherine O=Hagan Wolfe\nClerk of Court\n* The BIA and Government incorrectly contend that Lin abandoned\nwithholding of removal and CAT relief. The IJ relied on Lin\u2019s\nfailure to satisfy his burden for asylum to deny all forms of\nrelief.\n5",

Judgment and sentence affirmed; remanded for fee\nissue only.\n\u00b6 2 Defendant, Rene Salazar-Corona, was convicted of criminal sexual assault and sentenced\nto eight years in prison. On appeal, defendant contends that: (1) the trial court erred when it\nallowed the State to admit multiple prior consistent statements of the victim into evidence, orNo. 1-17-2496\nalternatively, trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to each of the prior consistent\nstatements; (2) defendant\u2019s sentence was excessive; and (3) the trial court improperly assessed\ncharges against defendant. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment and sentence of the\ntrial court, and remand only the issue of fees to the circuit court.\n\u00b6 3 BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 At trial, the following evidence was presented. On January 18, 2015, the victim, A.D.,\nattended a work party at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago with her boyfriend, Paul Green. Green\nworked as a bar manager at a restaurant called Bacinos. Prior to the party, A.D. met Green at a\nbar, Harding Tavern, to watch a football game. A.D. testified that she drank two craft beers at\nHarding Tavern. They then went to another bar, Emerald Loop, where A.D. drank two or three\nmore beers and had one or two shots of liquor. Green and A.D. then left Emerald Loop to go to\nthe party at the Hyatt Regency.\n\u00b6 5 A.D. testified that she felt intoxicated by the time she arrived at the party, which was in a\nsuite at the hotel. There were about 12-15 people at the party, but she only knew Green and one\nother woman. A.D. testified that she did not recall drinking more alcohol at the party, but she had\ndifficulty remembering the events of that portion of the night. The next thing A.D. remembered\nwas that she was in a bedroom that was connected to the suite. A.D. could not recall how she got\ninto the bedroom.\n\u00b6 6 A.D. testified that the first thing she saw when she woke up was a naked man, who she\ndid not know, on top of her. A.D. stated that the man\u2019s penis was \u201cbrushing\u201d against her vagina.\nA.D. was not wearing any clothes. A.D. put her hands on the man\u2019s chest and pushed him away.\nThe man was not wearing a condom.\n2No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 7 A.D. testified that she found her clothes and went into the bathroom. She put her clothes\non, then went to find Green, who was asleep in another room. She could not remember what she\nsaid to Green verbatim but remembered telling him that somebody raped her. A.D. testified that\nGreen was initially confused but left the room and A.D. later saw him yelling at and fighting\nwith defendant.\n\u00b6 8 A.D. testified that she called 911. An ambulance arrived, and A.D. went to the hospital,\nwhere she spoke with a nurse, a doctor, and the police. A criminal sexual assault kit was\ncompleted at the hospital. She was given antibiotics, Advil, a prescription for an anti-HIV\nmedication, and the morning-after pill to prevent pregnancy.\n\u00b6 9 Green testified that he worked with defendant at Bacinos. Green was the bar manager,\nand defendant was the line cook. Green testified that on January 18, 2015, he went to Harding\nTavern to watch a football game. A.D. met him there, and he saw her drinking craft beer. They\nthen went to Emerald Loop, where A.D. drank five to six beers and two shots of liquor. They left\nEmerald Loop somewhere between 10 and 10:30 pm.\n\u00b6 10 Green testified that the suite at the Hyatt Regency where the party took place had one\nlarge master bedroom with couches, and an attached second bedroom with two queen beds.\nGreen saw that defendant was at the party. Green and A.D. continued to drink. Later in the\nevening, Green noticed that A.D.\u2019s speech had become slurred and she was not making sense.\nShe was also having trouble standing and had to lean on Green.\n\u00b6 11 Green testified that he decided to put A.D. to bed in the attached bedroom at around\n11:30 pm. He helped her into one of the beds and took her boots off. She was fully clothed.\nGreen left the bedroom and rejoined the party, periodically checking on A.D. to make sure she\ndid not get sick. Green did not see anyone else in the room during his checks.\n3No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 12 Green testified that he continued to drink throughout the evening, and that he believed\ndefendant took some tequila shots along with everyone else at some point. Sometime between\n1:30 and 2 a.m., Green fell asleep on one of the couches in the suite.\n\u00b6 13 Green woke up to A.D. telling him that she \u201cjust woke up to someone raping [her.]\u201d\nGreen went into the second bedroom and saw defendant sleeping in the second bed of that room.\nGreen went back out to A.D. and asked what happened. Defendant then came out of the bedroom\nand Green began to fight with defendant. A.D. then ran past Green, and he saw her get into an\nambulance at 4:30 a.m.\n\u00b6 14 Bryan Haragan, a Bacinos employee, testified that he attended the Hyatt party with about\n10 other people, all of whom he knew. Green and A.D. arrived at the party soon after Haragan\ndid. Haragan testified that he served A.D. three shots of liquor at the party. A.D. had trouble\nbalancing and had to lean against a table and Green for support. Her speech was slurred. Haragan\nsaw Green take A.D. into the second bedroom and did not see her for the rest of the night.\n\u00b6 15 Haragan testified that by 1:30 to 2 a.m., most of the partygoers had left. Haragan, Green,\nand a handful of others remained. Haragan went to sleep on a couch at about 3 a.m. Sometime\nafter he laid down, he saw defendant go into A.D.\u2019s bedroom and close the door. Around 4 or\n4:30 a.m., Haragan woke up to Green chasing defendant with what appeared to be a fork.\nHaragan testified that he did not see A.D. and defendant speak to each other during the party.\n\u00b6 16 Maria Cerna, a paramedic for the Chicago Fire Department, testified that at about 4:40\na.m., she received a dispatch to the Hyatt Regency for an alleged sexual assaulted. Cerna spoke\nwith A.D., who stated that she had been sexually assault. She did not notice A.D. slurring her\nspeech, staggering, or smelling like alcohol.\n4No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 17 Julie Bembenista, a registered nurse at Northwestern Hospital, testified that on January\n19, 2015, she treated A.D. at around 7:50 a.m. Bembenista started a criminal sexual assault kit.\nA.D. told her that she woke up naked and was vaginally penetrated by defendant.\n\u00b6 18 Angela Kaeshamer, a forensic scientist with the Illinois State Police Forensic Science\nCenter, testified that she found the DNA of two people from A.D.\u2019s vaginal swab \u2013 A.D. and\ndefendant.\n\u00b6 19 Defendant testified on his own behalf, with the help of a Spanish language interpreter. He\nstated that he arrived at the Hyatt at 10:40 p.m. on the night in question. He drank and socialized\nwith everyone there, including A.D. He did not know A.D. was Green\u2019s girlfriend. At some\npoint, he saw Green walk A.D. to a bedroom. A.D. appeared drunk but was walking fine.\nDefendant continued to enjoy the party until about 1 or 2 a.m. Others found places to sleep,\nincluding Green. Defendant testified that at about 3 a.m., A.D. came to the doorway of the\nbedroom and summoned him inside. They began to kiss and remove their clothing. They had sex\nfor ten to fifteen minutes until he ejaculated. A.D. never told him to stop. Defendant testified that\nA.D. was drunk during the encounter, but that he was also drunk. Defendant testified that he\nwould not have engaged in sex with A.D. if he thought she was too drunk.\n\u00b6 20 Defendant testified that A.D. then changed back into her clothes and left the room. She\nwas not crying or upset. Defendant got dressed and went to sleep on the other bed. After a few\nminutes, Green came into the bedroom and screamed at him. He attacked defendant with a\nplastic fork. A.D. called an ambulance, but defendant thought it was because he was bleeding.\nHe saw A.D. get into an ambulance as he left the hotel.\n\u00b6 21 A.D. testified that she did not speak Spanish.\n5No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 22 The jury found defendant guilty of criminal sexual assault after 14 hours of deliberation.\nDefendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the State failed to prove him guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. The court denied the motion.\n\u00b6 23 The trial court sentenced defendant to eight years in prison. Defendant moved for\nreconsideration, arguing that the sentence was excessive. The court rejected the motion.\nDefendant now appeals.\n\u00b6 24 ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 25 On appeal, defendant contends that: (1) the trial court erred when it allowed the State to\nadmit multiple prior consistent statements of the victim into evidence, or alternatively, trial\ncounsel was ineffective for failing to object to each of the prior consistent statements; (2)\ndefendant\u2019s sentence was excessive; and (3) the trial court improperly assessed certain charges\nagainst defendant.\n\u00b6 26 Defendant\u2019s first contention is that the trial court erred when it allowed into evidence\nthree prior consistent statements that A.D. gave to her boyfriend, a paramedic, and a nurse.\nSpecifically, defendant complains of Green\u2019s testimony that A.D. told him she had been raped,\nCerna\u2019s testimony that A.D. stated she had been sexually assaulted, and Bembenista\u2019s testimony\nthat A.D. told her she was vaginally penetrated by defendant. The State responds that the\ncomplained-of testimony was neither objected to at trial or raised in a posttrial motion, and thus\nhas been forfeited for review. See People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 122 (2007) (to preserve\nclaimed improper statements for review, a defendant must object to the statements both at trial\nand in a written posttrial motion). Defendant acknowledges that he failed to preserve this claim\nof error but requests this court to nevertheless review the claim under the plain error doctrine.\nThe plain error doctrine is applicable when: \u201c \u2018(1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the\n6No. 1-17-2496\nevidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against\nthe defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred\nand that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial and challenged the\nintegrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\u201d \u2019 People v.\nThompson, 238 Ill. 2d 598, 613 (2010) (quoting People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565\n(2007)). Here, defendant claims that the evidence was closely balanced, and thus review is\nwarranted under the first prong of the plain error doctrine. We disagree.\n\u00b6 27 In determining whether the closely balanced prong has been met, we must make a\n\u201ccommonsense assessment\u201d of the evidence (People v. White, 2011 IL 109689, \u00b6 139) within the\ncontext of the circumstances of the individual case (People v. Adams, 2012 IL 111168, \u00b6 22). To\nprove a defendant guilty of criminal sexual assault, the State must show that (1) defendant\ncommitted an act of sexual penetration while (2) he knew that A.D. was unable to understand the\nnature of the act or was unable to give knowing consent to the sexual penetration. See 720 ILCS\n5/11-1.20(a)(2) (West 2014). There is no question that defendant sexually penetrated A.D. where\nhe admitted he did, and where defendant\u2019s DNA was found on the A.D.\u2019s vaginal swab that was\nperformed at the hospital. Additionally, the State provided overwhelming evidence that A.D. was\nunable to give knowing consent to the sexual penetration. A.D., Green, and Haragan all testified\nthat A.D. was unable to stand on her own at the Hyatt and was slurring her words. Green testified\nthat he had to assist A.D. into bed where she immediately fell asleep and remained asleep\nthroughout the evening. Both A.D. and defendant testified that they had never met each other\nprior to that evening. A.D. and defendant did not speak to each other at the party. Haragan\ntestified as he laid down after the party, he saw defendant go into the bedroom where A.D. was\nsleeping and close the door. Haragan did not give any testimony regarding A.D. summoning\n7No. 1-17-2496\ndefendant into the bedroom. A.D. testified that she woke up with defendant on top of her, and his\npenis brushing up against her vagina. The evidence gathered from the rape kit that was\nperformed at the hospital identified defendant\u2019s DNA on A.D.\u2019s vaginal swab.\n\u00b6 28 The fact that defendant offered an alternate story at trial \u2013 that A.D. woke up after being\ncompletely passed out all evening, came to the door of the suite (without Haragan seeing her),\nseduced defendant despite not talking to him all evening and not speaking Spanish, decided to\nwake her boyfriend up after having sex with defendant to tell him she was raped, and called an\nambulance to take her to the hospital in order to corroborate her own story \u2013 does not make the\nevidence presented in this case closely balanced. See Adams, 2012 IL 111168, \u00b6 22 (\u201cWe think it\nclear from the foregoing that defendant\u2019s explanation of events, though not logically impossible,\nwas highly improbable,\u201d and therefore evidence not closely balanced); People v. Young, 2013 IL\nApp (2d) 120167, \u00b6 31 (case not closely balanced where the defendant\u2019s evidence was merely\nher self-serving testimony that she had not admitted buying cocaine).\n\u00b6 29 Additionally, we disagree with defendant\u2019s theory that this case was closely balanced\nbecause the jury took 14 hours to deliberate and submitted 5 questions to the court. Lengthy\ndeliberations and jury notes do not require a finding that the evidence was closely balanced.\nPeople v. Nugen, 399 Ill. App. 3d 575, 584 (2010) (\u201cWe reject the general premise a lengthy\ndeliberation necessarily means the evidence is closely balanced.\u201d); see also People v. Walker,\n211 Ill. 2d 317, 342 (2004) (\u201cthe length of time a jury deliberates is not always an accurate\nindicator of whether the evidence was closely balanced.\u201d); People v. Vasquez, 368 Ill. App. 3d\n241, 251 (2006) (despite jury note indicating deadlock, evidence not closely balanced where two\nofficers testified they saw defendant with firearm, despite defense witness contradicting that\ntestimony); People v. Smith, 341 Ill. App. 3d 530, 543 (2003) (\u201cGiven that we have found the\n8No. 1-17-2496\nevidence against defendant to be overwhelming, the jury\u2019s deliberations alone do not indicate\nthat the evidence was closely balanced.\u201d). Rather, lengthy jury deliberations and jury notes are\nmerely considered as part of a commonsense analysis in the context of the totality of the\nevidence. Nugen, 399 Ill. App. 3d at 585. We have considered these factors and find that this\ncase is not closely balanced. Accordingly, the plain error doctrine does not apply, and any claims\nregarding prior consistent statements have been forfeited by defendant.\n\u00b6 30 Defendant\u2019s next argument on appeal is that his sentence is excessive. Defendant\ncontends the trial court abused it discretion in sentencing him to eight years in prison. Defendant\ncontends that the trial court did not give the proper weight during mitigation to his lack of\ncriminal history, steady employment, and the reliance of his family on his income. The State\nresponds that the trial court did not abuse its discretion where it weighed each of these factors\nand sentenced defendant to a term within the statutory range for a criminal sexual assault\nconviction. We agree with the State.\n\u00b6 31 \u201cThe sentencing decisions of a trial court are entitled to great deference and weight\nbecause \u2018a trial judge is in a far better position than an appellate court to fashion an appropriate\nsentence\u2019 based on firsthand consideration of the defendant\u2019s credibility, demeanor, moral\ncharacter, and other relevant factors.\u201d People v. Weatherspoon, 394 Ill. App. 3d 839, 862 (2009)\n(quoting People v. Govea, 299 Ill. App. 3d 76, 91 (1998)). \u201cThe seriousness of the crime is the\nmost important factor in determining an appropriate sentence, not the presence of mitigating\nfactors such as lack of a prior record, and the statute does not mandate that the absence of\naggravating factors requires the minimum sentence be imposed.\u201d People v. Quintana, 332 Ill.\nApp. 3d 96, 109 (2002). A trial court is not required to give greater weight to the rehabilitative\n9No. 1-17-2496\npotential of a defendant than to the seriousness of the offense. Weatherspoon, 394 Ill. App. 3d at\n862.\n\u00b6 32 A sentence within the statutory range is presumed proper. People v. Phillip C., 346 Ill.\nApp. 3d 822, 833 (2006). \u201cWhen the circuit court hears mitigation evidence, it is assumed that it\nconsidered that evidence, absent some contrary indication other than the sentence imposed.\u201d\nPeople v. Whitehead, 171 Ill. App. 3d 900, 908 (1988). We will not reverse a sentence imposed\nby the trial court unless there has been an abuse of discretion, which is the most deferential\nstandard of review. People v. Etherton, 2017 IL App (5th) 140427, \u00b6 15. Here, defendant was\nconvicted of criminal sexual sexual assault, a Class 1 felony, which carries a sentencing range of\n4 to 15 years in prison. 720 ILCS 5/11-1.20 (West 2014).\n\u00b6 33 At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, defense counsel presented evidence in mitigation that\ndefendant had a child who he financially supported, defendant had been consistently employed,\nand defendant\u2019s criminal background consisted only of a 2003 DUI. The trial court noted that\ndefendant \u201cpresents as an upstanding citizen,\u201d stating that he worked hard and supported his\nchild. Defense counsel also argued that defendant was inebriated on the night in question,\nresulting in a lack of judgment. Nevertheless, the trial court had to weigh those mitigating factors\nagainst the seriousness of the crime. Defendant was convicted of penetrating A.D.\u2019s vagina with\nhis penis, while she was asleep and unable to consent. A.D. had to go to the hospital, submit to a\nrape kit and STD test, take a morning-after pill, and take antibiotics. We find that the trial court\ndid not abuse its discretion in any way when it weighed the seriousness of the crime, the\nevidence in aggravation, and the evidence in mitigation when making its sentencing decision that\nwas well within the sentencing range for this crime.\n10No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 34 Finally, both parties agree that because of the recent amendment to Illinois Supreme\nCourt Rule 472 (eff. May 17, 2019), defendant\u2019s claims concerning the Electronic Citation Fee\nand the State Police Operations Fee, should be remanded to the circuit court. Rule 472(a)\nprovides that in criminal cases, the circuit court retains jurisdiction to correct sentencing errors\nrelating to the following:\n\u201c(1) Errors in the imposition or calculation of fines, fees, assessments, or costs;\n(2) Errors in the application of per diem credit against fines; (3) Errors in the\ncalculation of presentence custody credit; and (4) Clerical errors in the written\nsentencing order or other part of the record resulting in a discrepancy between the\nrecord and the actual judgment of the court.\u201d\n\u00b6 35 Rule 472 (c) states that \u201c[n]o appeal may be taken by a party from a judgment of\nconviction on the ground of any sentencing error specified above unless such alleged error has\nfirst ben raised in the circuit court.\u201d This rule was made effective on March 1, 2019.\n\u00b6 36 However, on May 17, 2019, Rule 472 was amended to add section (e) which states, \u201c[i]n\nall criminal cases pending on appeal as of March 1, 2019, or appeals filed thereafter in which a\nparty has attempted to raise sentencing errors covered by this rule for the first time on appeal, the\nreviewing court shall remand to the circuit court to allow the party to file a motion pursuant to\nthis rule.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 472(e) (eff. May 17, 2019). Accordingly, defendant\u2019s claims concerning\nthe Electronic Citation Fee and the State Police Operations Fee must be remanded to the circuit\ncourt for defendant to file an appropriate motion.\n\u00b6 37 CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 38 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and sentence, but remand\nonly for defendant to file a motion for his fee claims.\n11No. 1-17-2496\n\u00b6 39 Affirmed; remanded in part.\n12",

Tunheim, Chief United States District Judge\nfor the District of Minnesota, sitting by designation.removal proceedings based on materially changed country conditions. We have\njurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of\na motion to reopen, Iturribarria v. INS, 321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir. 2003), and we\ndeny the petition for review.\nThe BIA did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Zewdu failed to\ndemonstrate materially changed country conditions in Ethiopia to qualify for the\nexception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen. See 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Zewdu presented evidence of\nescalated violence in Ethiopia against Oromo and Amhara individuals and\nevidence that he had participated in political demonstrations in the United States.\nHowever, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the new evidence did not demonstrate prima\nfacie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention\nAgainst Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) was not \u201cillogical, implausible, or without support in\ninferences that may be drawn from the record.\u201d1 United States v. Hinkson, 585\nF.3d 1247, 1263 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc).\n1 On appeal, Zewdu argues that the BIA \u201cignored and failed to analyze the\ndocumentary evidence he submitted in support of his [CAT] claim.\u201d We disagree.\nThe BIA properly considered the arguments and evidence submitted in support of\nZewdu\u2019s CAT claim.\n2First, the BIA did not improperly discount the affidavits submitted in\nsupport of Zewdu\u2019s motion to reopen with regard to (1) Zewdu\u2019s political activity,\n(2) the conditions in Ethiopia, or (3) the extent to which Oromo and Amhara\nindividuals are targeted. See Avagyan v. Holder, 646 F.3d 672, 678-79 (9th Cir.\n2011). To the contrary, the BIA accepted the evidence submitted as true, but\nconcluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the Ethiopian\ngovernment would target him. Second, Zewdu failed to produce evidence of an\nindividual risk or harm.2 Notably, Zewdu did not present any new evidence of\nthreats to him or his family. Finally, the worsening conditions did not materially\naffect Zewdu\u2019s claim for asylum based on his political opinion and ethnicity.\nDespite worsened human rights conditions in Ethiopia, Zewdu failed to produce\nsufficient evidence to show that his circumstances have materially changed since\nhis previous proceeding.\n2 Zewdu argues that the BIA should have considered his claim as one of a\npattern and practice of persecution, thereby lessening the threat of individual\npersecution he needs to establish. However, the BIA properly rejected any claim\nthat Zewdu was a member of a disfavored group or that there was a pattern or\npractice of persecution. See Wakkary v. Holder, 558 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir.\n2009). Even though the record shows the Ethiopian government targets politically\nactive Oromo and Amhara citizens, this evidence is insufficient to establish a\npattern and practice of persecution. See id. at 1060-62 (holding that widespread\ndiscrimination was insufficient to show pattern and practice of persecution even\nwhere there were some incidents of persecution).\n3PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.\n4",

After careful\nreview, we affirm.\nOn April 26, 2014, Wallace was charged with six counts each of\nstalking,1 terroristic threats,2 harassment,3 and intimidation of witnesses or\nvictims,4 in connection with conduct involving his 21-year-old niece, Krystal\n____________________________________________\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2709.1(a)(1).\n2 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2706(a)(1).\n3 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2709(a).\n4 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4952(a)-(b).J-S68016-19\nScott. After a three-day trial that concluded on May 29, 2015, a jury convicted\nhim of all charges. The trial court set forth the facts of this case as follows:\nDuring the summer of 2013, [Wallace] and his sister, Tammy\nRuggieri, re-established contact with one another. [Wallace] had\nbeen in and out of [Ruggieri\u2019s] life throughout the years, and he\nhad not been around her, or her family, for quite some time.\n[Ruggieri] was assisting [Wallace] in obtaining an apartment as\nhe was getting his life back in order. [Ruggieri] asked her\ndaughter, [Scott], to give [Wallace] a chance to be a part of her\nlife. [Scott] was 21 years old at the time of her mother\u2019s request,\nand she had not seen [Wallace] since she was approximately ten\n(10) years old.\nAt first, [Scott] was excited to build a relationship with [Wallace],\nand the relationship between them was \u201cfine\u201d and \u201ccordial.\u201d At\nthe time, [Scott] was attending school full[-]time at Robert Morris\nUniversity and was also employed and working as a bartender at\nMcFadden\u2019s. As time went on, the nature of their relationship\nchanged dramatically, and for the worse. [Wallace] began to\nexcessively call and text [Scott] over the next few months.\n[Scott] became afraid of [Wallace\u2019s] behavior, and she informed\nher mother that the excessive contact was \u201cweirding her out.\u201d In\naddition to the sheer number of calls being problematic, [Scott]\nwas concerned and stressed over the fact that [Wallace] would\nbecome angry when she would not respond to his calls and\nmessages. [Ruggieri] became involved in the situation, telling\n[Wallace] that he needed to limit his calls and texts to [Scott]\nbecause the frequency of his calls and text messages was\ninappropriate.\nDespite this warning, [Wallace\u2019s] behavior continued and\nescalated, becoming more threatening over the next several\nmonths. [Wallace] was angry at [Scott] after her mother spoke\nwith him about the frequency of his contact with [Scott], and he\nresponded by calling and texting [Scott] \u201cnumerous times a day\u201d\n\u201call day every day.\u201d In November of 2013, [Scott] grew so\ndesperate for the contact to stop that she obtained a Protection\nfrom Abuse Order (PFA) against [Wallace]. Notwithstanding the\ncourt order, [Wallace] did not cease contact. In fact, the situation\nappeared to grow worse after [Scott] secured the PFA. In January\nof 2014, [Wallace] left two (2) disturbing voicemails on\n- 2 -J-S68016-19\n[Ruggieri\u2019s] work phone. The voicemails were about [Scott] and\nher bartending job at McFadden\u2019s, and they were extremely\nhostile and threatening in nature. Among other things, [Wallace]\nfalsely accused [Scott] of being a \u201cstripper\u201d and giving \u201clap\ndances\u201d at McFadden\u2019s. The messages further warned that \u201cthe\ncrazy man\u201d was coming for her. After listening to these\nvoicemails, [Scott] became \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d of [Wallace] and\ncalled the police.\nAlthough [Wallace] was arrested and taken into custody after the\nJanuary 2014 voicemails, his contact with [Scott] did not cease.\n[Wallace] wrote [Scott] numerous letters from the Allegheny\nCounty Jail (ACJ), receiving so many that she \u201clost count.\u201d\nHowever, there were six (6) letters that [Wallace] sent between\nApril 8, 2014, and May 2, 2014 that were particularly threatening.\nThe majority of these letters were eight (8) pages long and\ncontained writing from the top to bottom of a legal-sized page. In\nthese letters, [Wallace] used highly vulgar, disturbing and\nthreatening language, acknowledging that he knew he was not\nsupposed to be contacting [Scott], and attempting to manipulate\nand guilt her into dropping the charges against him. These letters\nterrified [Scott], and she was afraid for her life. Although she was\npreviously a straight \u201cA\u201d student, [Scott] started missing school\nbecause of the stress generated by the letters. She lost sleep and\nfocus. [Wallace\u2019s] behavior resulted in [Scott] suffering a great\namount of fear, and his threats continue to go through her mind\n\u201cevery single day.\u201d\nTrial Court Opinion, 2/12/16, at 5-7 (citations omitted).\nOn July 15, 2015, Wallace was sentenced to an aggregate term of\nseven-to-fourteen years\u2019 imprisonment followed by an eleven-year term of\nprobation. Id. at 2. Wallace filed a motion to reconsider sentence, which the\ncourt denied on August 26, 2015. Wallace then filed a direct appeal, and our\nCourt affirmed his judgment of sentence on December 23, 2016.\nCommonwealth v. Wallace, 1486 WDA 2015 (Pa. Super. filed Dec. 23,\n2016) (unpublished memorandum). Wallace filed a petition for allowance of\n- 3 -J-S68016-19\nappeal, which our Supreme Court denied on June 20, 2017. Commonwealth\nv. Wallace, 169 A.3d 581 (Pa. 2017) (Table).\nOn January 16, 2018, Wallace filed a pro se PCRA petition; the court\nappointed PCRA counsel, who filed an amended petition on August 27, 2018,\nraising claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Following an evidentiary\nhearing, the court dismissed Wallace\u2019s petition on February 28, 2019. Wallace\ntimely filed a notice of appeal and court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal.\nOn appeal, Wallace presents the following issues for our consideration:\n(1) Was appellate counsel ineffective for not arguing that the\nevidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that [Wallace] committed the\noffense of terroristic threats at counts 11, 15, and 23,\ninsofar as the respective letters of April 18, April 21, and\nMay 2, 2014, did not threaten to commit any crime of\nviolence against [Scott], nor did they contain language\nestablishing beyond a reasonable doubt that [Wallace]\nintended to terrorize [Scott]?\n(2) Was appellate counsel ineffective for not arguing that the\nevidence was insufficient as a matter of law to prove,\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that [Wallace] committed the\noffense of intimidation of a witness at count 9[,] insofar as\nthe content of the letter of April 18, 2014, fails to establish\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that [Wallace] was intimidating,\nor attempting to intimidate [Scott] from informing or\nreporting information relating to the commission of a crime?\nBrief of Appellant, at 4 (capitalization removed).\nOur standard and scope of review for the denial of a PCRA petition are\nwell-settled. We review the PCRA court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether\nthey are supported by the record, and review its conclusions of law to\n- 4 -J-S68016-19\ndetermine whether they are free from legal error. Commonwealth v. Spotz,\n84 A.3d 294, 311 (Pa. 2014). The scope of our review is limited to the findings\nof the PCRA court and the evidence of record, viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the prevailing party at the trial level. Id.\nIn both of his claims, Wallace argues appellate counsel was ineffective\nfor failing to raise challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence on direct\nappeal. The law presumes that counsel was effective, and the burden rests\non the appellant to prove otherwise. Commonwealth v. Ousley, 21 A.3d\n1238, 1244 (Pa. Super. 2011). To prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, Wallace\nmust establish: (1) his underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) appellate\ncounsel had no reasonable basis for his or her action or inaction; and (3)\nappellate counsel\u2019s error prejudiced Wallace such that there is a reasonable\nprobability the outcome at trial would have been different absent such error.\nCommonwealth v. Fears, 86 A.3d 795, 804 (Pa. 2014). \u201cFailure to prove\nany prong of this test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim.\u201d Id.\nWith regard to the second element, an appellant must show that:\n[I]n light of all the alternatives available to counsel, the strategy\nactually employed was so unreasonable that no competent lawyer\nwould have chosen it. We inquire whether counsel made an\ninformed choice, which at the time the decision was made\nreasonably could have been considered to advance and protect\n[the] defendant\u2019s interests.\nCommonwealth v. Buska, 655 A.2d 576, 582-83 (Pa. Super. 1995). \u201cIf\ncounsel\u2019s chosen course had some reasonable basis, the inquiry ends and\n- 5 -J-S68016-19\ncounsel\u2019s assistance is deemed effective.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 899\nA.2d 1060, 1064 (Pa. 2006).\nHere, Wallace has failed to establish that appellate counsel lacked a\nreasonable basis for choosing not to raise the sufficiency of the evidence\nchallenges specified above. For both ineffectiveness claims, the extent of\nWallace\u2019s argument regarding appellate counsel\u2019s decision is a bald assertion\nthat \u201ccounsel could not have had a reasonable basis\u201d for failing to raise the\nsufficiency challenge. See Brief of Appellant, at 14, 19. Boilerplate\nallegations, such as these, are insufficient to rebut the presumption that\ncounsel was effective. Commonwealth v. Jones, 815 A.2d 598, 612 (Pa.\n2002). Moreover, the record belies Wallace\u2019s assertion. See N.T. PCRA\nHearing, 2/27/19, at 6.\nAt the PCRA hearing, appellate counsel testified that she chose to forego\nthe sufficiency claims on direct appeal in order to focus on Wallace\u2019s strongest\nand most viable claim, which related to the alleged deprivation of his right to\ntestify. Id. Although she found the sufficiency challenges to be non-frivolous,\nappellate counsel believed that it would be more beneficial for Wallace if she\nzealously argued what she perceived to be his strongest claim. Id. Appellate\ncounsel had concerns that the detailed, fact-heavy analysis necessary to argue\ninsufficiency of the evidence would have overshadowed and detracted from\nthe stronger issue on appeal. Id.\n- 6 -J-S68016-19\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has explicitly held that counsel\nneed not, and indeed should not, raise every non-frivolous claim on appeal.\nSmith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 288 (2000). Our Supreme Court has also\nrecognized that counsel \u201cmay forego even arguably meritorious issues in favor\nof claims which, in the exercise of counsel\u2019s objectively reasonable\nprofessional judgment, offered a greater prospect of securing relief.\u201d Jones,\nsupra at 613. \u201cThis process of \u2018winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal\nand focusing on\u2019 those more likely to prevail, far from being evidence of\nincompetence, is the hallmark of effective appellate advocacy.\u201d Id. at 614\n(quoting Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751-52 (1983)).\nWallace has failed to establish that appellate counsel had no reasonable\nbasis for her decision not to raise the sufficiency of the evidence challenges.\nAccordingly, appellate counsel cannot be deemed ineffective, and Wallace is\nentitled to no relief.5 Williams, supra at 1064.\nOrder affirmed.\n____________________________________________\n5 Furthermore, after a thorough review of the record, the parties\u2019 brief, the\napplicable law, and the well-reasoned opinion of Judge Lazzara, we conclude\nthat Wallace\u2019s underlying sufficiency of the evidence challenges do not have\narguable merit. There was sufficient evidence to prove Wallace guilty of both\nterroristic threats and intimidation of a witness or victim where Wallace\ndirectly and indirectly threatened to commit crimes of violence against the\nvictim and attempted to guilt, manipulate, and intimidate her into dropping\nthe charges against him and absenting himself from court proceedings. See\nTrial Court Opinion, 2/12/16, at 12-32.\n- 7 -J-S68016-19\nJudgment Entered.\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\nDate: 2/10/2020\n- 8 -",

Appellant has filed a statement of inability to afford payment of costs on\nappeal.\nChapter 14 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code governs inmate\nlitigation when the inmate claims inability to pay costs. Chapter 14 applies to \u201can\naction, including an appeal or original proceeding, brought by an inmate in a district,county, justice of the peace, or small claims court or an appellate court, including\nthe supreme court or the court of criminal appeals, in which an affidavit or unsworn\ndeclaration of inability to pay costs is filed by the inmate.\u201d Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.\nCode \u00a7 14.002(a). \u201cThis means that the requirements of Chapter 14 apply when\ninmates file an appeal or an original proceeding in the appellate court the same as\nwhen they file actions in the district, county, and justice courts.\u201d Douglas v. Moffett,\n418 S.W.3d 336, 339 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 2013, no pet.).\nWhen an inmate litigant files an affidavit or unsworn declaration of inability\nto pay costs, Chapter 14 requires the inmate to file an additional affidavit or\ndeclaration setting forth specific details on all previous actions filed pro se, other\nthan a suit brought under the Texas Family Code:\nAn inmate who files an affidavit or unsworn declaration of inability to\npay costs shall file a separate affidavit or declaration (1) identifying\neach suit, other than a suit under the Family Code, previously brought\nby the person and in which the person was not represented by an\nattorney, without regard to whether the person was an inmate at the time\nthe suit was brought; and (2) describing each suit that was previously\nbrought by (A) stating the operative facts for which relief was sought;\n(B) listing the case name, cause number, and the court in which the suit\nwas brought; (C) identifying each party named in the suit; and (D)\nstating the result of the suit, including whether the suit was dismissed\nas frivolous or malicious under Section 13.001 or Section 14.003 or\notherwise.\nTex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7 14.004.\nAppellant did not file the required affidavit or unsworn declaration of previous\nfilings. Id. \u00a7 14.004(a). On November 12, 2019, notification was transmitted to the\nparties of this court\u2019s intention to dismiss the appeal unless appellant complied with\nsection 14.004 by December 12, 2019. See Tex. R. App. P. 42.3(a). On November\n25, 2019, we received an unsworn declaration from appellant entitled, \u201cAffidavit of\n2Inability to Pay Filing Fee.\u201d The declaration states the reasons appellant is unable to\npay the filing fee, and it is accompanied by a certified copy of the trust account\nstatement. The declaration does not identify and describe any previous actions\nappellant may have brought as required by subsection (a). On December 17, 2019,\nwe issued an order directing appellant to file an affidavit regarding previous filings\nby January 16, 2020.

Colleen sought an\ninjunction, preventing Diane from hindering Colleen\u2019s communication with, and access to,\nPatricia; a finding that Diane breached her fiduciary duties as Patricia\u2019s agent; and Diane\u2019s removal\nas such. Pursuant to Colleen\u2019s request, the trial court entered a qualified protective order under\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) (Pub. L. No. 104-191,\n\u00a7 264, 110 Stat. 1936 (1996)) rules addressing disclosure of protected health information (45\nC.F.R. \u00a7 164.512(e) (2016) (authorizing production of records containing protected health\ninformation if the party seeking production requests a protective order)), authorizing the parties to\nsubpoena Patricia\u2019s protected health information. In a limited-scope appearance, Patricia,\nasserting her physician-patient privilege (735 ILCS 5/8-802 (West 2018)), moved to enjoin\nColleen from seeking subpoenas for her medical records. The trial court denied the motion.\nPatricia appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in denying injunctive relief, where it failed to\napply to her medical records the physician-patient privilege. We dismiss the appeal for lack of\njurisdiction.\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 On February 2, 2017, Colleen, who resides in Nebraska, filed her initial complaint against\nher sister, Diane, who resides in Du Page County. In a single-count amended complaint, filed on\n1 Various portions of the record contain the alternative spelling of \u201cDianne\u201d for defendant.\nFor consistency, we use \u201cDiane.\u201d\n- 2 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nMarch 27, 2018, Colleen sought review of Diane\u2019s conduct as Patricia\u2019s agent and requested\nappropriate relief under section 2-10(a) of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act (Act) (755 ILCS\n45/2-10(a) (West 2018) (allowing any interested person to petition the trial court, upon a finding\nthat the principal lacks capacity to control or revoke the agency, to construe a power of attorney,\nreview the agent\u2019s conduct, and grant appropriate relief, including compensatory damages).\nColleen alleged that Diane was acting as Patricia\u2019s agent under Patricia\u2019s purported power of\nattorney for health care, dated February 22, 2016, a copy of which she attached to her amended\ncomplaint.2\n\u00b6 5 Colleen further alleged that, in 2011, Patricia, who lived in Nebraska with her son, Richard\nMasek (who has autism and developmental/intellectual disabilities), had undergone testing that\nrevealed significant memory loss and cognitive decline and she was prescribed\ndementia/Alzheimer\u2019s medication. According to Colleen, in February 2014, to Colleen\u2019s surprise,\nDiane and her husband removed Patricia and Richard from their Nebraska home and moved them\nto Diane\u2019s home in Downers Grove, where they have since resided. Since that time, Diane has\nbeen Patricia\u2019s caretaker and primary decisionmaker.\n\u00b6 6 In 2014, Patricia was in the moderate-to-late stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, suffered from\nsevere short-term memory loss, and needed a caregiver. Colleen alleged that, at this time, Diane\n2 Twice previously, Diane had acted as Patricia\u2019s agent under purported powers of attorney\nfor health care, dated January 27, 2016, and July 18, 2015. She had also acted as Patricia\u2019s agent\nunder Patricia\u2019s purported durable power of attorney, dated July 17, 2015, and another such\ndocument dated November 27, 2013. Prior to the execution of the health care powers of attorney,\nPatricia had named Colleen as agent under her January 29, 2008, power of attorney for health care.\n- 3 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nadmitted that she wanted Colleen and her family to be with Patricia as much as possible, but was\nconcerned that Colleen would attempt to move Patricia and Richard back to Nebraska and, thus,\nwould not allow Colleen to visit alone with them. Prior to her removal from Nebraska, Patricia\nhad frequent and positive interactions with Colleen and her family. Following her removal from\nNebraska, Patricia has had limited interaction with Colleen and her family, according to Colleen,\ndue to Diane\u2019s involvement, conduct, and decisions she has made for Patricia. Colleen further\nalleged that Patricia\u2019s estrangement and isolation from her and her family (and other family\nmembers and friends) directly result from Diane\u2019s involvement, conduct, and decisions made for\nPatricia and influence on her. Colleen alleged that she and others have attempted to visit and\ncommunicate with her mother, but have not received any reply.\n\u00b6 7 Colleen further asserted that, as agent for Patricia, Diane undertook a fiduciary duty to her\nand is required to act in Patricia\u2019s best interests. Colleen argued that Diane breached that duty by\nprohibiting her mother from visiting or communicating with Colleen and her family and caused\nPatricia to have mistaken or delusional views concerning Colleen in order to perpetuate the\nestrangement and isolation fostered by Diane, all of which were contrary to Patricia\u2019s true wishes\nand desires (as expressed, in part, in her deposition taken in one of the family\u2019s Nebraska trust-\nrelated cases). Colleen further asserted that Diane\u2019s conduct was not in Patricia\u2019s best interests,\nand the harm therefore was irreparable in the absence of an injunction. Diane was not acting in\nPatricia\u2019s best interests, and Patricia\u2019s desire to visit and communicate with her, Colleen asserted,\nshowed that Colleen was likely to be successful on the merits of her claim. She also argued that\nno adequate legal remedy existed, because the matter involved family visitation and\ncommunication, Diane\u2019s decision-making, and Patricia\u2019s diagnoses and declining health.\n- 4 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\n\u00b6 8 Colleen sought an order: (1) preliminarily enjoining Diane from preventing or hindering\nPatricia from reasonable access, visitation, and communication with Colleen and her\ngrandchildren; (2) directing Diane to allow Colleen reasonable access to, visitation, and\ncommunication with Patricia (and vice versa); (3) finding that Diane breached her fiduciary duties\n(as agent) to Patricia and failed to appropriately act as Patricia\u2019s agent pursuant to section 2-10 of\nthe Act; (4) removing Diane as Patricia\u2019s agent; (5) granting judgment in Colleen\u2019s favor; (6)\npermanently enjoining Diane from prohibiting, preventing, or otherwise hindering Patricia from\nreasonable access, visitation and communication with Colleen; and (7) attorney fees and costs.\n\u00b6 9 In her answer, Diane asserted that the decision to move to her home was Patricia\u2019s. She\nalso denied that she was Patricia\u2019s decisionmaker and denied that Patricia lacked capacity to handle\nher personal and financial affairs. Diane also asserted that she had not hindered Patricia from\ncommunicating with Colleen, argued that Patricia\u2019s deposition testimony was taken out of context,\nand denied that Patricia desired to communicate with Colleen.\n\u00b6 10 On June 22, 2018, Diane moved for summary judgment, asserting that, since January 15,\n2018, Patricia no longer resided in Illinois and, on May 29, 2018, Patricia had discharged Diane\nas agent under her healthcare power of attorney. (She attached her affidavit attesting to this, along\nwith a copy of a letter purportedly from Patricia informing her that her power of attorney had been\nrevoked and a new agent assigned. She did not attach a copy of any new power of attorney for\nhealthcare.) Diane argued that, pursuant to section 2-10 of the Act, the court had jurisdiction to\nadjudicate the case only if a principal had appointed an agent and the principal either cannot control\nor revoke the agency. Based upon the termination of the healthcare power of attorney, she\ncontended, there was no genuine issue of material fact but that Patricia had the ability to terminate\nthe power of attorney and had done so.\n- 5 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\n\u00b6 11 On March 12, 2019, the court denied Diane\u2019s summary-judgment motion \u201cfor the reasons\nstated on the record.\u201d The record on appeal does not contain a report of proceedings from the\nhearing.\n\u00b6 12 Subsequently, on August 1, 2019, Colleen moved for entry of a protective order pursuant\nto Illinois Supreme Court Rule 201(c)(1) (eff. May 29, 2014) (allowing courts to regulate\ndiscovery \u201cto prevent unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or\noppression\u201d) and the HIPAA rules addressing disclosure of protected health information (45\nC.F.R. \u00a7 164.512(e) (2016) (authorizing production of records containing protected health\ninformation if the party seeking production requests a protective order)). She asserted that\nassessment of Patricia\u2019s capacity to revoke or control Diane\u2019s conduct as her agent was required\nin assessing whether Diane breached her duties to Patricia. Colleen argued that Patricia\u2019s medical\nrecords would likely lead to the discovery of admissible evidence concerning her capacity to\ncontrol her agent\u2019s conduct. Colleen asserted that she intended to issue subpoenas for the\nproduction of records related to Patricia\u2019s medical treatment, which would include protected health\ninformation under HIPAA, and desired a protective order to comply with the statute and protect\nagainst unauthorized disclosure of private and/or confidential medical information and to prevent\nabuse of any information by the subpoenaed entities.\n\u00b6 13 Colleen served Diane\u2019s counsel with a copy of the motion and a notice of motion, setting\nthe matter for presentation on August 6, 2019, but Patricia was not served with a notice or a copy\nof the motion. Diane did not file a response to the motion.\n\u00b6 14 On August 6, 2019, the trial court, noting in its written order that Patricia\u2019s counsel had\napproached but did not file an appearance, granted Colleen\u2019s motion for a qualified HIPAA order,\nset October 11, 2019, as the discovery cutoff, and continued the case for status on October 15,\n- 6 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\n2019. On August 8, 2019, the trial court entered the qualified HIPAA protective order, pursuant\nto Rule 201(c)(1), federal regulations, and the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities\nConfidentiality Act (740 ILCS 110/1 et seq. (West 2018)). The order authorized the parties to\nreceive, subpoena, and transmit Patricia\u2019s protected health information in a manner reasonably\nconnected with this case. The following day, Patricia retained counsel, Douglas Drenk.\n\u00b6 15 On August 20, 2019, Colleen served Diane with a notice of subpoenas, noting that\nsubpoenas of Patricia\u2019s healthcare providers were being served that day via certified mail. Notice\nwas apparently not sent to Patricia. On August 21, 2019, Drenk filed on Patricia\u2019s behalf a notice\nof limited scope appearance pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 13(c)(6) (eff. July 1, 2017)\nfor the purpose of protecting the privacy of Patricia\u2019s medical records. (Patricia\u2019s son, Mark,\nsigned the notice as agent for legal matters on Patricia\u2019s behalf.)\n\u00b6 16 Also on August 21, 2019, Patricia (through Drenk) moved to enjoin Colleen from seeking\nthe issuance of any subpoenas relating to her medical records. Patricia asserted her physician-\npatient privilege (735 ILCS 5/8-802 (West 2018)), which, she argued, applies to nonparties, and\nfurther maintained that the privilege was not preempted by HIPAA because she was a non-party\nto the litigation. Patricia sought an order \u201c[d]ismissing\u201d Colleen\u2019s motion for a protective order\nover her medical records and an order that enjoined Colleen from issuing subpoenas for her\nmedical records.\n\u00b6 17 In response, Colleen asserted that the court had already ruled on the issue when (on August\n6, 2019) it granted Colleen\u2019s motion for protective order and subsequently (on August 8, 2019)\nentered the HIPAA order, authorizing the issuance of subpoenas. She noted that Patricia never\npursued a motion to reconsider (or an appeal) and never moved to quash the subpoenas previously\nissued; thus, her argument was forfeited. She also asserted that arguments concerning Patricia\u2019s\n- 7 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nmedical privacy were sufficiently covered by the court\u2019s protective order. Colleen also argued\nthat equity demanded that Patricia\u2019s motion be denied, because she remained in contempt of court\nin separate guardianship proceedings (in Du Page County). She further argued that Patricia\u2019s\nmedical records were relevant, because her medical condition was an issue in this case. Finally,\nColleen offered to withdraw the subpoenas if Patricia sat for a deposition.\n\u00b6 18 On October 10, 2019, the trial court held a hearing on several matters and entered an order\nthat: (1) denied Patricia\u2019s motion to enjoin Colleen from seeking issuance of subpoenas relating to\nher medical records3; (2) granted Colleen\u2019s motion to extend time for discovery, which was\nextended to December 6, 2019; and (3) took under advisement Colleen\u2019s petition for rule to show\ncause against Patricia (for failure to comply with a subpoena for a deposition). The court continued\nthe case to December 12, 2019, for status. In denying Patricia\u2019s motion to enjoin Colleen from\nsubpoenaeing her medical records, the court noted at the hearing, \u201cWe entered a protective order\nsome time ago. I understand your arguments. Most of them, if not all of them, are that she\u2019s a\nnon-party. There\u2019s a physician-patient privilege involved. But the issue in this case, the medical\nrecords may be relevant and we have a protective order. So I\u2019m denying your motion.\u201d The court\nalso noted that the sole issue in the case is whether Diane exercised authority as an agent. Patricia\nappeals.4\n3 Colleen served seven subpoenas via certified mail on August 20, 2019. Patricia filed her\nmotion to enjoin the following day. As noted, the court did not rule on Patricia\u2019s motion until\nOctober 10, 2019.\n4 On November 12, 2019, the trial court denied Patricia\u2019s motion, filed November 4, 2019,\nfor a stay pending appeal. On November 14, 2019, Patricia moved in this court for a stay pending\n- 8 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\n\u00b6 19 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 20 We first review our jurisdiction over this appeal. Patricia filed this appeal pursuant to\nIllinois Supreme Court Rule 307(a)(1) (eff. Nov. 1, 2017) (interlocutory appeals as of right; appeal\nfrom an interlocutory order \u201cgranting, modifying, refusing, dissolving, or refusing to dissolve or\nmodify an injunction\u201d) within 30 days of the trial court\u2019s order denying her motion to enjoin\nColleen from seeking the issuance of subpoenas relating to her medical records (and wherein she\nhad requested dismissal of Colleen\u2019s motion for a protective order over her medical records and\nan order that enjoined Colleen from issuing subpoenas for her medical records). The HIPAA\nprotective order limits the use of Patricia\u2019s protected health information to this litigation and\nrequires the return or destruction of the records at the end of the litigation.\n\u00b6 21 In her appellee\u2019s brief, Colleen argues that the October 10, 2019, order denying Patricia\u2019s\nmotion is not an injunctive order, but a discovery order from which interlocutory appeal cannot be\ntaken; thus, in her view, this court lacks jurisdiction to hear Patricia\u2019s appeal. Colleen contends\nthat, regardless of how Patricia labeled her motion, it substantively sought to quash subpoenas\nColleen issued to Patricia\u2019s medical providers. Orders regarding preliminary discovery, she notes,\nsuch as the denial of a motion to quash, are not final orders and, therefore, are not appealable.\nKmoch v. Klein, 214 Ill. App. 3d 185, 191 (1991). Colleen argues that, notwithstanding Patricia\u2019s\nattempt to couch the denial of her motion as injunctive in order to fall under Rule 307\u2019s scope, it\nremains that discovery orders are not appealable under Rule 307. Id. at 192.\n\u00b6 22 In Kmoch, this court dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, an appeal from two interlocutory\norders denying the defendant\u2019s motions to quash deposition subpoenas sought pursuant to a\nappeal. We granted the motion on December 3, 2019.\n- 9 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nmental-health confidentiality statute. Id. at 192. The individuals whose depositions the plaintiff\nsought to take had treated the defendant in relation to another court proceeding. This court held\nthat the orders were not final, but interlocutory, \u201cmade as preliminary discovery orders in a pending\nsuit.\u201d Id. at 191. They were not appealable, \u201cbecause they are reviewable on appeal from the final\norder.\u201d Id. The treaters could either obey or defy the order and, if it resulted in a contempt finding,\nsuch judgment would be a final and appealable order. Id. Turning to Rule 307, this court declined\nto follow In re Marriage of Lombaer, 200 Ill. App. 3d 712, 721 (1990), a case on which Patricia\nrelies, which had held that the reviewing court had jurisdiction under Rule 307 to address an appeal\nfrom orders directing the discovery deposition of a medical provider pursuant to a mental-health\nconfidentiality statute. The Lombaer court had characterized the orders as effectively enjoining a\nparty and her physician from asserting their privilege. Id. at 192 (quoting Lombaer, 200 Ill. App.\n3d at 721). In Kmoch, this court instead followed supreme court precedent that, addressing the\nrules for interlocutory orders, determined that \u201c \u2018[d]iscovery orders are not made appealable under\nthe provisions of these rules.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting People ex rel. Scott v. Silverstein, 87 Ill. 2d 167, 171\n(1981)). We also found support for our conclusion in the practice notes to Rule 307, which\nprovided that, even though they have injunctive qualities, discovery orders are not reviewable\nunder the rule. Id. at 192-93 (quoting Ill. Ann. Stat., ch. 110A, par. 307, Historical & Practice\nNotes, at 263 (Smith-Hurd 1985)).\n\u00b6 23 In her reply brief, Patricia maintains that this court has jurisdiction to review the denial of\ninjunctive relief to prohibit disclosure of her medical records protected under the physician-patient\nprivilege. She argues that Kmoch is distinguishable because it involved a party defendant\u2019s appeal\nunder a mental-health confidentiality statute and that she, in contrast, is a non-party. She also\nargues that we should decline to follow Kmoch, where it does not state that a non-party is\n- 10 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nprohibited from seeking interlocutory appeal from the denial of injunctive relief to prevent\nunauthorized disclosure of the non-party\u2019s private medical records protected from disclosure by\nthe non-party\u2019s invocation of the statutory physician-patient privilege. Patricia also contends that\nshe cannot refuse to comply with or defy the discovery order granting Colleen\u2019s motion for a\nprotective order (or the resulting HIPAA order) in order to be held in contempt as a means of\nseeking immediate appellate review prior to a final judgment after trial. She also asserts that she\nherself cannot defy the subpoenas issued to her healthcare providers. Her privilege, she notes,\ncannot be restored on review from a final judgment after trial.\n\u00b6 24 We agree with Colleen that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. In Almgren v. Rush-\nPresbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center, 162 Ill. 2d 205 (1994), the supreme court reaffirmed the\nholding in Silverstein that pretrial discovery orders are not appealable under the Illinois Supreme\nCourt Rules governing interlocutory appeals. Id. at 211. \u201cAlthough such orders may have the\nqualities of an injunction in the sense that they compel the parties to do or not do a particular thing,\nthey are considered noninjunctive \u2018because they [do] not form part of the power traditionally\nreserved to courts of equity, but, instead, [are] part of the inherent power possessed by any court\nto compel witnesses to appear before it and give testimony.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting In re A Minor, 127 Ill.\n2d 247, 262 (1989)). Discovery orders \u201care subject to review, but they are not immediately\nappealable because they are reviewable on appeal from the final judgment.\u201d Id. Almgren was a\nmedical malpractice case brought against a hospital, and the hospital\u2019s counsel sought to conduct\nan ex parte interview with one of the plaintiff\u2019s treating physicians. The supreme court rejected\nthe appellate court\u2019s reasoning that the trial court\u2019s order had the effect of enjoining the plaintiff\nfrom asserting her patient-therapist privilege under a mental-health confidentiality statute. Id. at\n210-11. Specifically, it rejected the court\u2019s attempt to ignore Silverstein on the basis that, once the\n- 11 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\ninterviews were conducted and confidential information about the plaintiff was disclosed, any\npost-judgment appeal would be meaningless. Id. at 211. According to the supreme court, the\nplaintiff\u2019s right to complete confidentiality was lost when she filed her suit. Id. Also, the supreme\ncourt noted that Silverstein also involved a privilege (a newspaper reporter\u2019s assertion of the\nreporter\u2019s privilege statute). Id. at 212. The court agreed with this court\u2019s conclusion in Kmoch\nthat the same result as in Silverstein applied in the case before it, which involved a mental-health\nconfidentiality statute. Id.\n\u00b6 25 Although Silverstein involved motions to quash a discovery deposition subpoena and a\ndocument-production request, it is relevant here for two reasons. First, it involved a non-party,\nwhich is the same as this appeal. Second, Patricia\u2019s motion to enjoin Colleen from seeking the\nissuance of subpoenas relating to her medical records is, in essence, a motion to quash subpoenas\nof documents, the same scenario as in Silverstein, and, we believe, warranting the same result in\nthis case.\n\u00b6 26 Furthermore, we believe that Patricia is not so removed from this litigation as to accurately\nbe characterized as a non-party. Colleen brought her suit under the Act so that the trial court could\nassess Diane\u2019s execution of her agency over Patricia. 755 ILCS 45/2-10(a) (West 2018) (allowing\nan interested person, including a descendant, to petition for a finding that the principal lacks\ncapacity to control or revoke the agency, and allows the trial court to construe a power of attorney\nand review the agent\u2019s conduct). But the statute further requires the trial court to first determine\n\u201cthat the principal lacks either the capacity to control or the capacity to revoke the agency.\u201d Id.\nThus, the litigation concerns not only Diane, but also Patricia (more specifically, Patricia\u2019s\ncapacity as to the agency). Patricia\u2019s argument that her status as a non-party should render\nappealable the court\u2019s interlocutory discovery order fails. The trial court\u2019s denial of Patricia\u2019s\n- 12 -2020 IL App (2d) 190926-U\nmotion was a pretrial order concerning discovery, which the case law holds is not appealable under\nthe rules governing interlocutory appeals.\n\u00b6 27 We also reject Patricia\u2019s argument that she herself cannot disobey the subpoenas, which\nwere issued to her healthcare providers, so as to trigger a contempt finding, which, in turn, would\nbe appealable. Patricia\u2019s inability to seek immediate appeal from a contempt finding is not a reason\nto ignore supreme court precedent.\n\u00b6 28 In summary, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.\n\u00b6 29 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 30 For the reasons stated, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\u00b6 31 Appeal dismissed.\n- 13 -",

Shanes,\nDefendant-Appellant. ) Judge, Presiding.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nJUSTICE SCHOSTOK delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Hudson and Bridges concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: Defendant was proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of unlawful possession of\na weapon by a felon: the State presented sufficient evidence of actual possession in\nthat defendant was found in back seat of car with pistol in the rear pocket of the\nseat in front of him.\n\u00b6 2 Defendant, Gregory V. M. Harris Jr., and a female companion, Schelene Scott, rode in a\ncar with two other people to a park that had closed for the day. Defendant and Scott remained in\nthe back seat while the others walked to a nearby beach. A police officer encountered defendant\nand Scott in the car and recovered a loaded semiautomatic handgun from the rear pocket of the\nseat in front of defendant.2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\n\u00b6 3 A jury found defendant guilty of one count of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon\n(720 ILCS 5/24-1.1(a) (West 2016)). On direct appeal, defendant asserts that his conviction must\nbe reversed because the State did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had actual or\nconstructive possession of the weapon. We affirm.\n\u00b6 4 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 5 At 4 or 5 p.m. on May 24, 2016, Scott was riding in a car with Dontra Davis and a person\nshe identified as \u201cGabriel.\u201d Davis drove, but Scott did not know whether the car was his. Scott\nestimated that she was in the car for 15 minutes before the three picked up defendant. Scott had\nknown defendant for about two years before the incident. The four rode around for a few hours,\nstopping once to buy liquor. Scott conceded that she was intoxicated. Scott also had three prior\nconvictions of retail theft.\n\u00b6 6 Later in the evening, the group rode to the lakefront park at Round Lake. Scott knew that\nit was \u201cafter hours.\u201d She and defendant stayed in the car to smoke marijuana or drink while the\nother two walked to the beach. She did not see the handgun before the police found it.\n\u00b6 7 At about 10 p.m., Round Lake Beach police officer Marcian-Bogdan Butur drove by the\npark. Although the park closed at sunset, a car was in a parking area, which was poorly lit.\nButur stopped a few car-lengths away and illuminated the car with the patrol car\u2019s spotlight. He\nsaw defendant and Scott, sitting close together in the back seat. Scott was behind the driver\u2019s\nseat, and defendant was behind the front passenger seat. When the light hit them, \u201cthey separated\nimmediately.\u201d Butur left the spotlight pointed at the car and walked toward the driver\u2019s-side rear\ndoor. Butur noted \u201cthe distinct odor of cannabis in the air,\u201d which became stronger as he\napproached. The officer testified that he told defendant and Scott to exit the car, but only Scott\ncomplied:\n- 2 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\n\u201cIn a clear voice *** I requested both subjects exit[] the vehicle. The female\nopened the door behind the driver. She exited. The male remained in the car. I could\nsee his shoulders move and his hands move what I would call furtive movements, and [he]\ndid not respond to any verbal commands that I issued to him.\n***\n[He was r]eaching down by his feet underneath the front passenger seat in the\nimmediate area that he was sitting in. I could see shoulders moving up down, his head\nleft to right still unresponsive to verbal commands.\u201d\nThrough the window, the officer could see defendant\u2019s body only from the elbows up.\nFurthermore, Scott was between the officer and defendant while defendant made some of his\nfurtive movements.\n\u00b6 8 Butur ordered Scott and defendant to show their hands. Scott, who seemed \u201cgroggy,\u201d\n\u201cfix[ed] her clothing\u201d and then complied. Defendant continued to move his arms and eventually\nexited the car. Rather than showing his hands, he went around to the front passenger-side door\nand opened it. Butur unholstered his handgun, and defendant stepped away from the car so the\nofficer could see that his hands were empty.\n\u00b6 9 Butur asked the pair for identification. Neither would provide an identification card, and\ndefendant said falsely that his name was \u201cKeylan Stoker.\u201d A warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest was\non file.\n\u00b6 10 A backup officer arrived, giving Butur a chance to examine the car\u2019s interior with his\nflashlight. He saw \u201ca plastic cup with sort of reddish liquid inside\u201d on the floor near the front\npassenger seat and \u201cgreen plant[-]like material with the odor of cannabis over the floorboards of\nthe vehicle.\u201d\n- 3 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\n\u00b6 11 Defendant asked the officers to let him call his mother, but then he \u201ctook off running,\u201d and\nButur chased him. As defendant fled, he tipped garbage cans into the officer\u2019s path. Defendant\nfell three times, losing a shoe and his belt, before Butur caught him about two and a half blocks\nfrom the parking area.\n\u00b6 12 Butur resumed searching the car and found a black semiautomatic handgun in the pocket\non the front passenger seat-back. Butur took a photograph, which showed the butt of the gun\nprotruding just outside the seat pocket and facing right. The gun had a round in the chamber and\nnine rounds in the magazine. The safety was off.\n\u00b6 13 Round Lake Beach police officers Katherine Crawford and Roxanne Stacioiu responded to\nButur\u2019s request for backup. Crawford found Gabriel and Davis on the beach and directed them\nto go to her car. Davis fled, instead. Stacioiu testified that defendant became \u201cagitated\u201d and\nalso \u201ctook off running.\u201d\n\u00b6 14 The parties stipulated that defendant had a prior felony conviction and that no fingerprints\nuseful for comparison were found on the handgun or ammunition.\n\u00b6 15 The jury found defendant guilty of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. See 720\nILCS 5/24-1.1(a) (West 2016). The trial court denied defendant\u2019s posttrial motion challenging\nthe sufficiency of the evidence. The court found that defendant\u2019s prior convictions rendered him\neligible for a Class X felony sentence and imposed a 14-year prison term. Defendant timely\nappealed.\n\u00b6 16 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 17 A. Standard of Review\n\u00b6 18 Defendant asserts that his conviction must be reversed because the State did not prove\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he had actual or constructive possession of the handgun, an\n- 4 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\nessential element of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. See 720 ILCS 5/24-1.1(a)\n(2016) (\u201cIt is unlawful for a person to knowingly possess on or about his person or on his land or\nin his own abode or fixed place of business any weapon prohibited under Section 24-1 of this Act\nor any firearm or any firearm ammunition if the person has been convicted of a felony under the\nlaws of this State or any other jurisdiction.\u201d). The State argues that the State presented\noverwhelming evidence of either actual or constructive possession.\n\u00b6 19 We review the sufficiency of the evidence under the standard of Jackson v. Virginia, 443\nU.S. 307 (1979), as adopted by People v. Collins, 106 Ill. 2d 237 (1985). When a reviewing court\ndecides a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c \u2018the relevant question is whether, after\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in\noriginal.) Collins, 106 Ill. 2d at 261 (quoting Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319). \u201cUnder this standard, a\nreviewing court must allow all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the prosecution.\u201d\nPeople v. Davison, 233 Ill. 2d 30, 43 (2009).\n\u00b6 20 \u201cUnder [the standard of Jackson and Collins], the reviewing court does not retry the\ndefendant, and the trier of fact remains responsible for making determinations regarding\nthe credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given their testimony, and the reasonable\ninferences to be drawn from the evidence. [Citation.] But merely because the trier of\nfact accepted certain testimony or made certain inferences based on the evidence does not\nguarantee the reasonableness of its decision. A conviction will be reversed where the\nevidence is so unreasonable, improbable, or unsatisfactory that there remains a reasonable\ndoubt of [the] defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d People v. Ross, 229 Ill. 2d 255, 272 (2008).\n- 5 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\nHowever, the State is not required to present evidence that excludes every reasonable hypothesis\nof the defendant\u2019s innocence. E.g., People v. Larson, 379 Ill. App. 3d 642, 654 (2008).\n\u00b6 21 B. Actual Possession\n\u00b6 22 Possession of a prohibited item may be either actual or constructive. To show actual\npossession of contraband, the State must show that the contraband was \u201cin the immediate and\nexclusive control of [the] defendant.\u201d See People v. Frieberg, 147 Ill. 2d 326, 360 (1992) (stating\nthe rule for actual possession of a controlled substance). \u201cMere proximity is not sufficient\nevidence of actual possession.\u201d People v. Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d 75, 81 (2000). Actual possession\nrequires that the defendant exercise \u201cpresent personal dominion\u201d over the contraband; such\npossession exists when the defendant \u201cexercises immediate and exclusive dominion or control\u201d\nover the contraband. Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d at 82. \u201cActual possession does not require present\npersonal touching of the illicit material but, rather, present personal dominion over it.\u201d Schmalz,\n194 Ill. 2d at 82.\n\u00b6 23 The State may show actual possession through acts such as hiding or trying to dispose of\nthe contraband. E.g., People v. Carodine, 374 Ill. App. 3d 16, 25 (2007). In other words, a\ndefendant exhibits present personal dominion by doing things that tend to determine the fate of the\ncontraband.\n\u00b6 24 The State argues that defendant\u2019s furtive movements permit an inference that he was in\nactual possession of the gun. It contends that it is fair to infer that, when defendant was moving\nin the car with his hands out of Butur\u2019s view, he was either removing the gun from his person or\ntrying to push it out of sight in the seat pocket.\n- 6 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\n\u00b6 25 We agree with the State that the evidence adequately supports an inference that defendant\nplaced the gun in the seat pocket and therefore was in actual possession of it. Defendant could\nhave placed the gun there at any time while he was in the car.\n\u00b6 26 The jury was free to reject the inference that Davis, the driver, placed the gun in the seat\npocket and simply left it there when he walked to the beach. Butur found the gun in a place that\nwas readily accessible to a passenger in the rear-right seat, where defendant was seated. The\nrelative lack of access makes it less likely that the driver or front passenger left the gun in the\npocket. The evidence did not physically exclude the possibility that Davis abandoned a fully\nloaded semiautomatic handgun with a round in the chamber and the safety off. But although that\nscenario is possible, it is improbable; the State is not required to present evidence that excludes\nevery reasonable hypothesis of a defendant\u2019s innocence. Larson, 379 Ill. App. 3d at 654.\n\u00b6 27 Defendant notes that Scott denied seeing defendant handle the gun and indeed even seeing\nthe gun before the police seized it. This, if true, would undermine the inference that he placed the\ngun in the seat pocket. However, the jury could have reasonably concluded that Scott was not\ncredible. By her own account, she was intoxicated at the time, and her association with defendant\ncreated a motive for her to understate any observations that would tend to incriminate him.\n\u00b6 28 The jury could reasonably infer from the undisputed evidence that the gun was found in\nthe seat pocket in front of defendant because he placed it there. To prove actual possession, the\nState was not required to show the \u201cpresent personal touching\u201d (Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d at 82) of the\ngun by defendant, but merely his present personal dominion over it. See Schmalz, 194 Ill. 2d at\n82. The jury could reasonably infer that defendant had present personal dominion over the gun\nbecause he had attempted to hide it. See Carodine, 374 Ill. App. 3d at 25.\n\u00b6 29 C. Constructive Possession\n- 7 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\n\u00b6 30 The State\u2019s second theory of possession is that defendant\u2019s proximity to the gun supports\nan inference that he intended to control it, that is, that he constructively possessed it. As\ndiscussed, the evidence supports a reasonable inference of defendant\u2019s actual possession of the\nweapon, and it also supports the State\u2019s theory of constructive possession.\n\u00b6 31 The State argues that defendant had constructive possession because his presence in the\nback seat gave him \u201cimmediate and exclusive control\u201d of the seat pocket where Butur found the\ngun. To show constructive possession of contraband, the State must show that, although the\ndefendant lacks \u201cactual personal present dominion\u201d over the contraband, he or she nevertheless\nhas \u201can intent and capability to maintain control and dominion.\u201d Frieberg, 147 Ill. 2d at 361.\n\u201cConstructive possession may be proved by showing that the defendant had knowledge of the\npresence of the contraband and had immediate and exclusive control over the area where the\ncontraband was found.\u201d People v. Love, 404 Ill. App. 3d 784, 788 (2010).\n\u00b6 32 Defendant concedes that a reasonable person could infer that he knew that a gun was in the\ncar, but he asserts that the evidence did not establish that he constructively possessed it. He also\nsuggests that Davis was the person who actually exercised dominion over the gun.\n\u00b6 33 In his reply brief, defendant further argues that his \u201cfurtive\u201d movements have explanations\nother than possessing the gun, such as his adjusting his clothing. He argues that mere proximity\nis not sufficient evidence of intent to exercise control over contraband, so that, without the\nevidence that the State seeks to draw from the \u201cfurtive\u201d movements, the location of the gun does\nnot support an inference that he intended to exert control over it.\n\u00b6 34 Defendant argues finally that People v. Wright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803 \u00b6 26, compels\nreversal because more evidence is required to show constructive possession. In Wright, the State\nalleged that the defendant \u201c \u2018knowingly carried on or about his person, a firearm, at a time when\n- 8 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\nhe was not on his own land or in his own abode or fixed place of business.\u2019 \u201d Wright, 2013 IL\nApp (1st) 111803, \u00b6 5. The evidence showed that several police officers, executing a search\nwarrant, entered a residence through an unlocked door. The defendant and another person,\nQuentin Mitchell, fled toward a flight of stairs to the basement. An officer saw Mitchell fall over\ndefendant on the way down, and the two suspects came to rest next to each other near a wall.\nWright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 7. The officer \u201cobserved a handgun \u2018just to the left of\u2019 and\n\u2018within inches of Mitchell\u2019s left hand.\u2019 \u201d Wright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 7.\n\u00b6 35 A second officer \u201cannounced there was another gun present.\u201d Wright, 2013 IL App (1st)\n111803, \u00b6 7. \u201cThe second gun was a \u2018Colt 45,\u2019 which was attributed to [the] defendant.\u201d Wright,\n2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 7.\n\u201c[The first officer] admitted that at no time did he see a weapon in [the] defendant\u2019s hands,\nnor did he see [the] defendant make any motion that would indicate or suggest that [the]\ndefendant discarded a weapon. Besides Mitchell and [the] defendant, three other people\nwere in the basement when the search warrant was executed. Wright, 2013 IL App (1st)\n111803, \u00b6 9.\n\u00b6 36 A third officer testified that,\n\u201c \u2018[a]s [he] came down the steps, [he] saw a gun protruding from underneath the\nDefendant.\u2019 The gun was protruding from the \u2018center mass\u2019 or torso area of [the]\ndefendant[, who was on his stomach]. *** The gun was \u2018inches\u2019 from [the] defendant\u2019s\nhands. [That officer] saw [another officer] step on [the] defendant\u2019s hand and yell out that\nthere was a gun.\u201d Wright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 10.\n- 9 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\nThe third officer \u201cclarified that although he saw the gun \u2018inches\u2019 from defendant\u2019s hand, he never\nactually saw the gun in [the] defendant\u2019s hand nor did he see [the] defendant make any motion\nsuggesting that he was disposing of the gun.\u201d Wright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 11.\n\u00b6 37 On appeal, the Appellate Court, First District, held that the State \u201cfailed to prove beyond a\nreasonable doubt that [the] defendant knowingly possessed the gun that was attributed to him.\u201d\nWright, 2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 26. The Wright court noted that, although two officers\n\u201ctestified the gun was found underneath [the] defendant, neither officer testified that [the]\ndefendant made any movements to indicate knowledge of a weapon.\u201d Wright, 2013 IL App (1st)\n111803, \u00b6 26. The court concluded that the evidence failed to show that the defendant \u201cexercised\nimmediate and exclusive control over the basement area where the gun was found.\u201d Wright, 2013\nIL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 26.\n\u00b6 38 In Wright, unlike this case, the State confined its argument to constructive possession and\ndid not argue that the defendant had actual possession of the gun. Wright, 2013 IL App (1st)\n111803, \u00b6 21. The Wright court emphasized that none of the officers saw the weapon in the\ndefendant\u2019s hands or noticed him move in a way to indicate that he was discarding a gun. Wright,\n2013 IL App (1st) 111803, \u00b6 26. Such evidence relates to actual possession, but the Wright court\ncited its absence as grounds for reversing a finding of constructive possession.\n\u00b6 39 In support of its holding, the Wright court also cited testimony that the defendant did not\nmake any movements to indicate his knowledge that he was lying on the gun. Wright, 2013 IL\nApp (1st) 111803, \u00b6 26. Assuming the defendant in Wright did not know that the weapon was\npresent, this case is factually distinguishable in that defendant concedes his awareness of the gun\nin the seat pocket. The defendant in Wright was part of a pile-up at the bottom of the stairs, near\nothers who were in the basement where the gun was found. In contrast, defendant in this case had\n- 10 -2020 IL App (2d) 170603-U\nimmediate and exclusive control of the area around the seat pocket because he deliberately sat\nwhere he had such control. The jury could infer that, even if defendant lacked actual personal\npresent dominion over the gun, he nevertheless had \u201can intent and capability to maintain control\nand dominion\u201d over it because he knew of its presence and had immediate and exclusive control\nof the seat pocket where it was found. See Frieberg, 147 Ill. 2d at 361; Love, 404 Ill. App. 3d at\n788.\n\u00b6 40 When considering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we\nconclude that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt the essential\nelements of unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. See People v. Cunningham, 212 Ill. 2d\n274, 278 (2004).\n\u00b6 41 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 42 For the reasons stated, we affirm defendant\u2019s conviction of unlawful possession of a\nweapon by a felon.\n\u00b6 43 Affirmed.\n- 11 -",

Hon. Courtnie R. Tucker, Magistrate.\nJudgment terminating parental rights, affirmed.\nAaron Bazzoli, Canyon County Public Defender; Alex W. Brockman, Deputy\nPublic Defender, Caldwell, for appellant.\nHon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Teri A. Whilden, Deputy Attorney\nGeneral, Boise, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nLORELLO, Judge\nJane Doe (2019-40) appeals from the judgment terminating her parental rights. Doe\nargues that the magistrate court erred in concluding that termination of her parental rights is in\nthe best interests of the children. We affirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nDoe is the mother of the three minor children in this action. Police removed the two\nolder children, John Doe I and John Doe II, from Doe\u2019s care after substantiating a report that\n1Doe had bruised the eldest child\u2019s upper lip while covering his mouth to stifle his crying. The\ntwo children were then placed in the protective custody of the Idaho Department of Health and\nWelfare. Case plans were developed for Doe and the children\u2019s fathers.1 While the child\nprotection case was pending, John Doe III was born. Because Doe had made little progress on\nher case plan, Doe III was also taken into the Department\u2019s protective custody.\nThe State eventually filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Doe and the\nchildren\u2019s fathers. Neither father contested the termination of his parental rights. Following\ntrial, the magistrate court terminated Doe\u2019s parental rights after finding clear and convincing\nevidence that she had neglected the children and that termination is in their best interests.2 Doe\nappeals.\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nOn appeal from a decision terminating parental rights, this Court examines whether the\ndecision is supported by substantial and competent evidence, which means such evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243,\n245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009). In a termination proceeding, due process and the\nsubstantial evidence test requires the trial court\u2019s findings be supported by clear and convincing\nevidence. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982); Doe v. Doe, 143 Idaho 343, 346, 144\nP.3d 597, 600 (2006); State v. Doe, 143 Idaho 383, 386, 146 P.3d 649, 652 (2006). Clear and\nconvincing evidence is generally understood to be evidence indicating that the thing to be proved\nis highly probable or reasonably certain. In re Doe, 143 Idaho 188, 191, 141 P.3d 1057, 1060\n(2006). Further, the magistrate court\u2019s decision must be supported by objectively supportable\ngrounds. Doe, 143 Idaho at 346, 144 P.3d at 600. The appellate court will indulge all reasonable\ninferences in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment when reviewing an order terminating parental\nrights. Doe, 148 Idaho at 245-46, 220 P.3d at 1064-65.\n1 Although Doe is married, she is not married to the biological and legal father of John\nDoe I. Doe\u2019s husband is, however, the presumptive legal father of John Doe II and John Doe III.\nHowever, the biological father of these children remains unknown.\n2 The magistrate court also terminated the parental rights of the two fathers involved in this\ncase. The decision to terminate their parental rights is not at issue in this appeal.\n2III.\nANALYSIS\nDoe argues the magistrate court erred in concluding that termination is in the children\u2019s\nbest interests. Specifically, Doe asserts that the magistrate court failed to give proper\nconsideration to the children\u2019s lack of permanent placement at the time of trial and Doe\u2019s\npotential to reunify with the children if given adequate mental health services. The State\nresponds that the magistrate court\u2019s decision to terminate was correct and had proper evidentiary\nsupport. We affirm the magistrate court\u2019s decision.\nAs alluded to above, Doe does not challenge the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion that the\nState established a statutory ground for termination or that the children were in the Department\u2019s\ncustody for fifteen of the past twenty-two months. Thus, our only task is to review the\nmagistrate court\u2019s conclusion that termination is in the children\u2019s best interests.\nOnce a statutory ground for termination has been established, the trial court must next\ndetermine whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parent-child relationship.\nIn re Aragon, 120 Idaho 606, 611, 818 P.2d 310, 315 (1991). When determining whether\ntermination is in the child\u2019s best interests, the trial court may consider the parent\u2019s history with\nsubstance abuse, the stability and permanency of the home, the unemployment of the parent, the\nfinancial contribution of the parent to the child\u2019s care after the child is placed in protective\ncustody, the improvement of the child while in foster care, the parent\u2019s efforts to improve his or\nher situation, and the parent\u2019s continuing problems with the law. In re Doe, 159 Idaho 192, 198,\n358 P.3d 77, 83 (2015); In re Doe, 156 Idaho 103, 111, 320 P.3d 1262, 1270 (2014). A finding\nthat it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights must still be made upon\nobjective grounds. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 953, 956-57, 277 P.3d 400, 403-04 (Ct. App. 2012).\nThe magistrate court concluded that terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights is in the children\u2019s\nbest interests due to her complete disengagement from parenting, unwillingness to access\navailable services to improve her situation, and the risk that she may physically abuse the\nchildren. In support of this conclusion, the magistrate court found that Doe had injured the eldest\nchild while attempting to stifle his crying. The magistrate court further found that Doe took no\nsteps to improve her parenting skills, made no progress on her case plan during the course of the\nprotection case, and failed to demonstrate she had obtained stable housing or income. Despite\n3repeated offers of visitation, Doe visited the children only once. Consequently, the magistrate\ncourt found that there remained a risk that Doe would abuse the children again if placed back in\nher care. Additionally, the children needed therapy services when they came into the\nDepartment\u2019s custody. The two older children suffered speech delays and aggression issues\nwhile the younger child required physical therapy to address an issue with his neck. Despite\nDoe\u2019s lack of participation in their therapy, the magistrate court found that the children showed\nsignificant improvement while in foster care.\nDoe does not challenge the above-described findings. Rather, Doe first argues that the\nmagistrate court failed to consider that leaving the children in her custody was the surest and\nquickest route to provide the children with permanency and stability. Although the children had\nyet to receive a permanent adoptive placement at the time of the termination trial, they were in a\npre-adoptive placement and were wellbonded with those foster parents. It is possible that these\npotential parents will decline to adopt the children; however, that does not mean the children\u2019s\npermanency and stability would be better served by leaving the children in Doe\u2019s custody. The\nmagistrate court\u2019s findings related to Doe\u2019s disengagement with the children, lack of progress on\nher case plan, and failure to demonstrate either a stable income or housing undermine the\nassertion that Doe was a viable avenue to provide permanency and stability to the children.\nDoe\u2019s alternative argument--that the magistrate court failed to take adequate\nconsideration of her potential to reunify with the children if given in-home mental health\ntreatment--is also unavailing. The magistrate court found that Doe demonstrated an inexplicable\nunwillingness to engage the outside world during the child protection case. After the children\nwere taken into the Department\u2019s custody, Doe expressed fears and anxiety about leaving her\nhome and riding in cars. Doe\u2019s case worker responded by referring Doe for an initial mental\nhealth evaluation in her home. Despite Doe\u2019s inability to identify any specific symptoms of\nmental illness, the evaluator found that Doe suffered from mild depression. Although the\nDepartment offered Doe additional mental health services, she failed to follow up on the offer.\nDoe asserts that \u201cit seems reasonable\u201d that she could complete a case plan that provided\nher in-home mental health services. However, the record does not contain evidence supporting\nthis assertion. Doe submitted no medical evidence showing she suffered fears of leaving her\nhome due to a mental illness or how in-home treatment would have affected her ability to parent.\n4Doe had the right to submit evidence showing how support services would have assisted her in\nparenting. See Idaho Dep\u2019t of Health & Welfare v. Doe, 151 Idaho 498, 509, 260 P.3d 1169,\n1180 (2011). However, Doe failed to present such evidence and does not allege that she was\nprevented from doing so. Consequently, we hold that Doe has failed to show error in the\nmagistrate court\u2019s decision to terminate her parental rights.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nThere was clear and convincing evidence supporting the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion\nthat terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights is in the children\u2019s best interests. Doe has failed to show\nerror in the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion. Accordingly, the magistrate court\u2019s judgment\nterminating Doe\u2019s parental rights is affirmed.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge BRAILSFORD, CONCUR.\n5",

No.\n4:18-cr-00014-BMM-1\nv.\nSTANLEY PATRICK WEBER, MEMORANDUM*\nDefendant-Appellant.\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the District of Montana\nBrian M. Morris, District Judge, Presiding\nSubmitted February 6, 2020**\nSeattle, Washington\nBefore: M. SMITH and N.R. SMITH, Circuit Judges, and TUNHEIM,*** District\nJudge.\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).\n* ** The Honorable John R. Tunheim, Chief United States District Judge\nfor the District of Minnesota, sitting by designation.Stanley Weber appeals his conviction, arguing that the district court abused\nits discretion when it allowed the prosecution to present certain propensity\nevidence at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 414. We have jurisdiction\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.\n1. Weber challenges the application of United States v. LeMay, 260 F.3d 1018\n(9th Cir. 2001) for determining whether to admit Rule 414 evidence. Weber\nasserts that \u201cthe LeMay analysis does not require courts to balance the probative\nvalue of [Rule 414] evidence against anything,\u201d \u201cgiv[ing] the government [a]\nforbidden blank check to admit sexual misconduct evidence whenever it wishes.\u201d\nWe disagree. In Lemay, we expressly acknowledged that \u201cevidence of a\ndefendant\u2019s prior acts of molestation will always be emotionally charged and\ninflammatory,\u201d id. at 1030 (emphasis added), and requires that the \u201cprotections of\nRule 403 remain in place to ensure\u201d that \u201cthe right to a fair trial remains adequately\nsafeguarded,\u201d id. at 1026. Indeed, LeMay demands that courts \u201ccarefully evaluate\nthe potential inflammatory nature of the proffered testimony\u201d against the probative\nvalue of the evidence offered. Id. at 1030. Thus, contrary to Weber\u2019s arguments,\ncourts applying LeMay must conduct the necessary Rule 403 balancing, admitting\nRule 414 evidence only when the LeMay factors suggest that its relevance is not\nsubstantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Id. at 1031.\n2In fact, although LeMay\u2019s factors do not require a court to explicitly state the\ndangers of the Rule 414 evidence at issue, the factors only make sense when one\nfirst acknowledges the inherently prejudicial nature of such evidence. If weighing\nevidence\u2019s prejudicial effect were not required under the Lemay analysis, the sole\nquestion for a court to consider would be whether the evidence was relevant; there\nwould be no need to consider the degree of relevance, as LeMay demands. See id.\nat 1027\u201330. Accordingly, weighing the prejudicial effect against the probative\nvalue of such evidence is a vital piece of the LeMay factor analysis.\nFinally, Weber argues that \u201cLemay must be improperly skewed,\u201d because\ncase law \u201cshows that district courts admit extraneous sexual misconduct evidence\nas a matter of course.\u201d However, Weber\u2019s conclusory argument is flawed. That\nevidence is routinely admitted doesn\u2019t necessarily prove that the analysis by which\nit is admitted is flawed, especially where, as here: (1) the analysis is, by its very\nnature, fact- and context-dependent, see id. at 1026\u201331; and (2) \u201cthe clear intent of\nCongress\u201d in enacting Rule 414 was \u201cthat evidence of prior similar acts be\nadmitted in child molestation prosecutions,\u201d id. at 1030; see also United States v.\nSioux, 362 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir. 2004) (noting that Rules 413\u2013415\n\u201cestablish[ed] a presumption\u2014but not \u2018a blank check\u2019\u2014favoring the admission of\npropensity evidence at both civil and criminal trials involving charges of sexual\n3misconduct\u201d). Thus, Weber\u2019s arguments that LeMay\u2019s factor analysis is unsound\nare unavailing.\n2. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the propensity\nevidence in this case. \u201cA district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings are reviewed for abuse\nof discretion.\u201d United States v. Thornhill, 940 F.3d 1114, 1117 (9th Cir. 2019). It\nis apparent from the record that the district court conducted the proper Rule 403\nbalancing in determining whether to admit the Rule 414 evidence. For example,\nthe district court only allowed some of the available propensity evidence\u2014one\nwitness to testify about each type of assault charged\u2014that it determined was most\nrelevant to the charged conduct. Furthermore, the court appropriately weighed the\nLeMay factors in admitting the evidence.\nThus, because the district court\u2019s determination was neither \u201cillogical,\u201d\n\u201cimplausible,\u201d nor \u201cwithout support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts\nin the record,\u201d it did not abuse its discretion in admitting this propensity evidence.\nPerry v. Brown, 667 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th Cir. 2012) (cleaned up) (quoting United\nStates v. Hinkson, 585 F.3d 1247, 1262 (9th Cir. 2009) (en banc)).\nAFFIRMED.\n4",

The suggested\nGuidelines range based on Rodish\u2019s criminal history was 141 to 177 months. At\nsentencing, Rodish sought a downward variance to the statutory mandatory minimum\nof 120 months and the government sought a sentence of 141 months, the bottom of\nthe Guidelines range. The district court1 sentenced Rodish to 130 months\u2019\nimprisonment.\nOn appeal, Rodish challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence,\nclaiming the district court erred in failing to appropriately balance the \u00a7 3553(a)\nfactors in light of certain mitigating factors such as the nature of his prior criminal\nconvictions (specifically that a majority of his criminal history points were derived\nfrom convictions for driving while barred), his childhood difficulties, his mental\nhealth conditions, and his performance while on pretrial release. These mitigating\nfactors, according to Rodish, were only given \u201ccursory\u201d consideration by the district\ncourt. He additionally argues the court gave too much weight to the nature and\ncircumstances of the larger conspiracy generally, rather than the facts surrounding his\noffense specifically. We disagree.\n\u201cOur review of the substantive reasonableness of sentences is \u2018narrow and\ndeferential,\u2019 and we have held it is only the \u2018unusual case when we reverse a district\ncourt sentence\u2013whether within, above, or below the applicable Guidelines range\u2013as\nsubstantively unreasonable.\u2019\u201d United States v. Saguto, 929 F.3d 519, 525 (8th Cir.\n2019) (quoting United States v. Feemster, 572 F.3d 455, 464 (8th Cir. 2009) (en\nbanc)). Upon careful review, we find that nothing in the sentencing court\u2019s colloquy\nwas cursory, nor do we find support for the contentions advanced on appeal that too\nmuch weight was given to the circumstances of the larger conspiracy at Rodish\u2019s\n1The Honorable Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger, United States District Judge for\nthe Southern District of Iowa.\n-2-sentencing. To the contrary, the district court addressed each \u00a7 3553(a) factor; it\ndirectly, and methodically, addressed Rodish\u2019s arguments regarding the mitigating\nfactors noted above; and appropriately balanced the nature of the entire conspiracy\nin light of Rodish\u2019s instant conviction. Indeed, as the district court stated, the below-\nGuidelines sentence it imposed reflects these considerations and was sufficient but\nnot greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing. United States v.\nDeering, 762 F.3d 783, 787 (8th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[W]here a district court has sentenced\na defendant below the advisory guidelines range, it is nearly inconceivable that the\ncourt abused its discretion in not varying downward still further.\u201d (alteration in\noriginal)).\nCognizant of the wide latitude we give the district court in the weight assigned\nto the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, United States v. Richart, 662 F.3d 1037, 1054 (8th Cir.\n2011), we find that the court did not abuse its discretion and Rodish\u2019s below-\nGuidelines sentence is not substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.\n______________________________\n-3-",

No. 16-3220\nHarold Graham, Superintendent, Auburn Correctional Facility,\nRespondent\u2013Appellee.\n_____________________________________\nFor Appellant: RICHARD M. LANGONE, Langone & Associates,\nMineola, NY\nFor Appellee: MICHELLE MAEROV, Assistant Attorney General\n(Nikki Kowalski, Deputy Solicitor General for\nCriminal Matters, on the brief), for Letitia James,\nAttorney General for the State of New York, New\nYork, NYAppeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nNew York (Singleton, J.).\nUPON DUE CONSIDERATION, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND\nDECREED that the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\nPetitioner\u2013Appellant Gordon B. Gross appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment denying\nhis petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Gross contends that he\nreceived constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel and that he is innocent. We assume the\nparties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.\n\u201cFederal courts considering habeas corpus petitions are generally barred from reviewing\nthe decisions of state courts insofar as those decisions are predicated on adequate and independent\nstate procedural grounds.\u201d Messiah v. Duncan, 435 F.3d 186, 195 (2d Cir. 2006). Here, the state\ncourt reviewing Gross\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction under New York Criminal Procedure Law\n\u00a7 440.10 held that Gross failed to properly raise his claims on direct appeal even though the issues\nregarding the performance of defense counsel were \u201creadily apparent on the face of the record.\u201d\nApp\u2019x 189. In addition, the state court noted that \u201c[e]ven if [it] were to address defendant\u2019s\ncontentions, it would not find in his favor.\u201d App\u2019x 190. Now, on appeal the government concedes\nthat there is not an independent and adequate state law ground for denying Gross\u2019s claim because\nNew York courts do not consistently deny \u00a7 440.10 claims when the same counsel represented the\ndefendant at trial and on appeal. See e.g., People v. Hoffler, 74 A.D.3d 1632, 1634 (N.Y. App.\nDiv. 2010). We agree that there was no adequate state law ground and, therefore, our habeas review\nis not barred. Lewis v. Conn. Comm\u2019r of Corr., 790 F.3d 109, 119\u201320 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding\nfederal habeas review is not precluded when the procedural bar is not a firmly established and\n2regularly followed practice).\nHaving determined that there is no procedural bar to our review, we now turn to Gross\u2019s\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.1 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in denying\na habeas petition de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d Drake v. Portuondo, 553 F.3d\n230, 239 (2d Cir. 2009). \u201cUnder the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996\n(\u2018AEDPA\u2019), a federal habeas court must apply a deferential standard of review to \u2018any claim that\nwas adjudicated on the merits in State court.\u2019\u201d Drake v. Portuondo, 321 F.3d 338, 343 (2d Cir.\n2003) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). AEDPA provides for federal habeas relief when the state\nadjudication:\n(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\nof the United States; or\n(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\nfacts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)\u2013(2)\n\u201cIn a petition for habeas relief alleging ineffective counsel, the question as to whether the\nmatter is governed by existing Supreme Court precedent \u2018is easily answered because the merits of\nsuch claims are squarely governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Strickland v. Washington.\u2019\u201d\nLindstadt v. Keane, 239 F.3d 191, 198 (2d Cir. 2001) (alterations omitted) (quoting Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 1511 (2000)). Under Strickland, \u201c[a]n ineffective assistance claim has two\ncomponents: A petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the\ndeficiency prejudiced the defense.\u201d Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 521 (2003) (citations omitted).\n1 Because we find that there is no procedural bar to federal habeas review, we need not reach the\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel and innocence claims that Gross raises to cure any\nprocedural bar.\n3\u201cTo establish deficient performance, a petitioner must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s representation\n\u2018fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668, 688 (1984)). \u201c[T]he record must demonstrate that counsel made errors so serious that\ncounsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Cornell v.\nKirkpatrick, 665 F.3d 369, 377 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). To\nestablish prejudice, \u201c[t]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\ncounsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In assessing prejudice, we consider the cumulative effect of the errors\ncommitted by counsel. Lindstadt, 239 F.3d at 199.\nWhen applying AEDPA deference to ineffective assistance of counsel claims, \u201c[t]he\nquestion is not whether a federal court believes the state court\u2019s determination under the Strickland\nstandard was incorrect but whether that determination was unreasonable\u2014a substantially higher\nthreshold.\u201d Rosario v. Ercole, 601 F.3d 118, 123 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal citation omitted). \u201c[I]t is\nnot enough for [the prisoner] to show a constitutional violation. He must also show that the state\ncourt\u2019s application of Strickland was not merely incorrect, but objectively unreasonable.\u201d Palacios\nv. Burge, 589 F.3d 556, 561\u201362 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHere, the Second Circuit granted a certificate of appealability for the following ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel claims: failing to object to the admission and improper use of the prior\nconsistent statement testimony of several witnesses, failing to seek limiting instructions as to how\nsuch evidence may be considered, and failing to object to the use of such testimony in the\nprosecutor\u2019s opening and closing statements. Upon review of the record, we do not think that Gross\n4has met the high standard established by AEDPA for habeas relief on the basis of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\nIn the last reasoned state court decision, the court examined Gross\u2019s claims under New\nYork\u2019s constitutional standard for ineffective assistance. As we have explained, \u201c[t]he first prong\nof the New York test is the same as the federal test; a defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s\nperformance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d See Rosario v. Ercole, 601 F.3d\n118, 124 (2d Cir. 2010) (citing People v. Turner, 5 N.Y.3d 476, 480 (2005)).2 The state court held\nthat Gross failed to meet the New York test\u2013\u2013and therefore the first prong of Strickland\u2013\u2013for\nineffective assistance. Specifically, the court held that, \u201cdefendant\u2019s trial counsel was thoroughly\nfamiliar with the underlying facts of the case, made sufficient pretrial motions, delivered\nappropriate opening and closing statements, raised appropriate objections, cross-examined the\nprosecution witnesses, and effectively presented a defense in furtherance of a reasonable trial\nstrategy in the face of strong opposing evidence.\u201d App\u2019x 192. We do not think that this conclusion\nis unreasonable.\nGross raises additional arguments regarding defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the\nadmission or use of prior consistent statements of various witnesses, but much of this testimony\nwas in fact admissible under New York law. See People v. Honghirun, 29 N.Y.3d 284, 290 (2017)\n(\u201cWhile it is generally improper to introduce testimony that the witness had previously made prior\nconsistent statements to bolster the witness\u2019s credibility, the use of prior consistent statements is\npermitted to . . . rebut a charge of recent fabrication, or to assist in explaining the investigative\n2 New York courts do not apply the second prong of Strickland, and \u201cneed not find that counsel\u2019s\ninadequate efforts resulted in a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors,\nthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Rosario, 601 F.3d at 123\u201324.\n5process and completing the narrative of events leading to the defendant\u2019s arrest.\u201d (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted)). Moreover, as the district court noted, the trial court struck\nthe prior consistent statements of two witnesses after defense counsel objected and instructed the\njury to disregard them. Gross v. Graham, No. 9:14-CV-00768-JKS, 2016 WL 11621787, at *7\n(N.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2016) (\u201c[C]ontrary to Gross\u2019s contentions in his Petition, defense counsel was\nsuccessful in having the statements struck from the record.\u201d). For these reasons, we find that Gross\nis not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\nNext, we turn to Gross\u2019s freestanding innocence claim. \u201cThe Supreme Court has not finally\nresolved the issue of whether there is a federal Constitutional right to be released upon proof of\nactual innocence.\u201d Friedman v. Rehal, 618 F.3d 142, 159 (2d Cir. 2010). Assuming for the sake\nof argument that there is a freestanding innocence claim, \u201cthe threshold showing for such an\nassumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high.\u201d Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 417\n(1993). While the Supreme Court has not articulated the standard for a freestanding innocence\nclaim, it has suggested that it would require more convincing proof of innocence than the standard\narticulated in Schlup v. Delo, which requires a movant to demonstrate that, \u201cin light of new\nevidence, \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d House v. Bell, 547 U.S. 518, 536\u201337, 555 (2006) (quoting Schlup v.\nDelo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995)).\nHere, Gross\u2019s new evidence offers additional support for his claim at trial that S.W.\u2019s\ndescription of the location or timing of the sexual assault in 2003 was inaccurate. Gross also offers\ntelephone records that further support his claim at trial that J.S.\u2019s visit, and her sexual assault,\ncould not have occurred before her thirteenth birthday as required for conviction under N.Y. Penal\n6Law \u00a7 130.96. After reviewing the evidence as a whole, we conclude that Gross has not\ndemonstrated that the newly discovered evidence would be sufficient to satisfy the high standard\nfor a freestanding innocence claim contemplated in Herrera. See Herrera, 506 U.S. at 417 (finding\naffidavits from eyewitnesses to the crime and witnesses to a confession that implicated another\nsuspect did not meet the high standard for a freestanding innocence claim); House, 547 U.S. at\n555 (finding evidence that discredited the trial\u2019s blood evidence and witness testimony that another\nsuspect confessed did not satisfy \u201cwhatever burden a hypothetical freestanding innocence claim\nwould require\u201d).\nWe have reviewed Gross\u2019s remaining arguments and conclude that they either fall outside\nthe scope of this court\u2019s certificate of appealability, which we decline to expand, or are without\nmerit. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\nFOR THE COURT:\nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court\n7",

BOONE, a/k/a Ronnie Boone,\nDefendant \u2013 Appellant.\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, at\nNorfolk. Henry Coke Morgan Jr., Senior District Judge. (2:16-cr-00126-HCM-RJK-1)\nArgued: December 11, 2019 Decided: February 7, 2020\nBefore KING, HARRIS, and RUSHING, Circuit Judges.\nDismissed by unpublished opinion. Judge King wrote the opinion, in which Judge Rushing\njoined. Judge Harris wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.\nARGUED: Jon Michael Babineau, JON M. BABINEAU, PC, Norfolk, Virginia, for\nAppellant. Andrew Curtis Bosse, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY,\nNorfolk, Virginia, for Appellee. ON BRIEF: G. Zachary Terwilliger, United States\nAttorney, Alexandria, Virginia, Melissa E. O\u2019Boyle, Assistant United States Attorney,\nOFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY, Norfolk, Virginia, for Appellee.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.KING, Circuit Judge:\nRonald W. Boone appeals from the district court\u2019s November 6, 2018 order denying\nhis motion to modify a condition of his supervised release. The court imposed concurrent\nthree-year terms of supervised release following Boone\u2019s guilty pleas to two fraud-related\noffenses. On appeal, Boone contests \u2014 as he did in the district court \u2014 a supervised\nrelease condition that prohibits him from operating a motor vehicle. Because Boone\nknowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal any condition of his supervised\nrelease in his plea agreement with the United States Attorney, and Boone\u2019s present\nchallenge to the supervised release condition is within the scope of that appeal waiver, we\nmust dismiss his appeal.\nI.\nA.\nOn September 15, 2016, the United States Attorney filed an information in the\nEastern District of Virginia charging Boone with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit\nhonest services wire fraud. With respect to the bank fraud charge, the information alleged\nthat, from September 2014 to June 2016, Boone had engaged in a scheme to defraud two\nfederally insured banks and that, during the fraud scheme, he fraudulently obtained a\n$13,200,000 loan. For the conspiracy charge, the information alleged that, from March\n2004 to December 2014, Boone had bribed a Norfolk city councilman with cash, dinners,\nand beach house access in exchange for votes on city ordinances that benefitted Boone\u2019s\nbusinesses.\n2On September 16, 2016, Boone pleaded guilty to both charges in the information\npursuant to a plea agreement with the United States Attorney. The plea agreement provides\nthat, in exchange for Boone\u2019s guilty pleas, the government will refrain from prosecuting\nany member of Boone\u2019s immediate family and potentially move for a sentence reduction\npredicated on Boone\u2019s cooperation in other criminal proceedings. The plea agreement also\ndescribes the \u201cMaximum Penalties\u201d for Boone\u2019s offenses, including a term of supervised\nrelease. See Supp. J.A. 1.1 Importantly, the plea agreement contains an appeal waiver\nwhereby Boone agreed to waive his right to appeal \u201cany sentence within the statutory\nmaximum . . . on any ground whatsoever.\u201d Id. at 4.2 Boone signed the plea agreement,\nattesting that he had reviewed the entire plea agreement with his lawyers, and that he\nunderstood and voluntarily agreed to its terms.\n1 Citations herein to the \u201cSupp. J.A. __\u201d refer to the contents of the Supplemental\nJoint Appendix filed by the parties in this appeal. And citations to the \u201cJ.A. __\u201d refer to\nthe contents of the Joint Appendix also filed by the parties in this appeal.\n2 The appeal waiver in the plea agreement provides:\nThe defendant . . . understands that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 affords a defendant the\nright to appeal the sentence imposed. Nonetheless, the defendant knowingly\nwaives the right to appeal the conviction and any sentence within the\nstatutory maximum described above (or the manner in which that sentence\nwas determined) on the grounds set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 or on any\nground whatsoever other than an ineffective assistance of counsel claim that\nis cognizable on direct appeal, in exchange for the concessions made by the\nUnited States in this plea agreement.\nSee Supp. J.A. 4. The only exception to the appeal waiver is for an ineffective assistance\nof counsel claim, and it is not relevant to this appeal.\n3During the September 16, 2016 plea hearing before the magistrate judge in Norfolk,\nBoone was placed under oath and confirmed that he had entered into the plea agreement\nwith the United States Attorney. Boone explained under oath that he understood the appeal\nwaiver and that his sentence could include a period of supervised release during which he\nwould be subject to court-imposed conditions. At the conclusion of the plea hearing, the\nmagistrate judge found that Boone\u2019s guilty pleas were knowing, voluntary, and supported\nby independent factual bases.\nOn March 20, 2017, the district court accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s findings,\nadjudged Boone guilty of the two offenses charged in the information, and conducted\nBoone\u2019s sentencing. During that hearing, the court calculated an advisory Sentencing\nGuidelines range of 37 to 46 months in prison and heard from the parties regarding the\nappropriate sentence. Pursuant to the government\u2019s obligations under the plea agreement,\nthe prosecutor requested an eighteen-month sentence. On the other hand, Boone asked for\na term of probation predicated on his \u201csignificant medical issues.\u201d See J.A. 55. In support\nof that leniency request, Boone\u2019s cardiologist testified at the hearing, explaining that Boone\nsuffers from hypertension so severe that the cardiologist was \u201cconcerned about [Boone\u2019s]\nsurvival, [even] independent of incarceration.\u201d Id. at 37.\nResponding favorably to the cardiologist\u2019s testimony, the district court sentenced\nBoone to three years of probation with twelve months of home confinement. The court\nconcluded that a probation sentence was appropriate in light of Boone\u2019s medical condition\nand remarked that sentencing Boone to \u201cany period of incarceration would . . . endanger\nhis life.\u201d See J.A. 57. In announcing Boone\u2019s sentence, the court set forth several standard\n4probation conditions and also imposed a special condition of probation prohibiting Boone\nfrom operating a motor vehicle (the \u201cDriving Condition\u201d). As the court explained, given\nBoone\u2019s medical condition, his operation of a motor vehicle would endanger himself and\nthe public. The court entered its criminal judgment on the day following the sentencing\nhearing.\nB.\nAbout four months after the district court entered its March 21, 2017 criminal\njudgment, a concerned citizen photographed Boone driving a car and sent the pictures to\nBoone\u2019s probation officer. When the probation officer confronted Boone, he lied and\ndenied having driven a motor vehicle. Boone relented only after being shown the\nphotographs depicting him driving. Based on that conduct, the probation officer filed a\nPetition on Probation, requesting that the district court issue a summons for Boone to show\ncause why his probation should not be revoked.\nOn August 9, 2017, the district court approved the Petition on Probation and ordered\nBoone to show cause why he should be permitted to remain on probation. About a month\nlater, on September 8, 2017, the court conducted a probation revocation hearing. During\nthat hearing, the court found that Boone had contravened the Driving Condition and thus\nviolated his probation. The court also determined that Boone\u2019s advisory Guidelines range\nfor the purposes of that proceeding was 3 to 9 months of imprisonment. The government\nrequested a within-Guidelines-range sentence of imprisonment, but Boone asked that he\nbe permitted to continue probation given his medical issues.\n5The district court rejected Boone\u2019s request, revoked his probation, and resentenced\nhim to sixty days in prison, followed by three years of supervised release on the bank fraud\nconviction and to a concurrent term of three years of supervised release on the conspiracy\noffense. The court imposed many standard conditions of supervised release and again\nimposed the Driving Condition as a special condition.3 On the same day as the probation\nrevocation hearing, the court entered an order reflecting its rulings, and \u2014 regarding\nBoone\u2019s conditions of supervised release \u2014 stated that those conditions \u201cshall otherwise\nbe the same as the terms of probation specified in the [c]ourt\u2019s judgment entered March\n21, 2017, including the special condition that [Boone] shall not operate a motor vehicle\nduring his term of supervised release.\u201d See J.A. 95. Boone did not appeal from that\nSeptember 8, 2017 order.\nC.\nBoone subsequently served his sixty-day term of incarceration and was released in\nNovember 2017. Thereafter, on February 8, 2018, Boone moved the district court to\nmodify the conditions of his supervised release, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2).4 As\n3 There are various categories of supervised release conditions. Some conditions\nare required by statute, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d), and others are so-called \u201cstandard\u201d\nconditions recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines for all defendants, see USSG\n\u00a7 5D1.3(c), p.s. A sentencing court may also impose \u201cany other condition it considers to\nbe appropriate,\u201d as long as the condition \u201creasonably relate[s]\u201d to certain statutory factors.\nSee United States v. Dotson, 324 F.3d 256, 260 (4th Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Such a condition is sometimes called a \u201cspecial\u201d condition.\n4 Section 3583(e)(2) of Title 18 of the United States Code authorizes a court to\n\u201cmodify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, at any time prior to the\nexpiration or termination of the term of supervised release.\u201d\n6pertinent here, Boone requested that the court strike the Driving Condition. For support,\nBoone attached to his motion a January 12, 2018 letter from his cardiologist, who opined\nthat Boone \u201cdoes not pose a risk to himself or others in the operation of a motor vehicle,\ntaking into consideration his current medical conditions.\u201d See Supp. J.A. 77. Boone also\nsupplied the court with a December 13, 2017 letter from his family physician, who offered\na similar opinion. The court entered an order denying Boone\u2019s motion on February 9,\n2018.\nOn August 1, 2018, Boone filed a second motion to modify his conditions of\nsupervised release. He again asked the district court to remove the Driving Condition,\nrelying primarily on the letters of his two physicians that he had submitted with his first\nmotion. The court entered an order denying the second motion on September 5, 2018.\nFinally, on November 1, 2018, Boone filed a third motion to modify the conditions\nof his supervised release (the \u201cThird Motion to Modify\u201d), which is the subject of this\nappeal. In support of the Third Motion to Modify, Boone offered another letter from his\ncardiologist, who opined that \u2014 as of October 31, 2018 \u2014 Boone could operate a motor\nvehicle without putting himself and the public at risk. The district court entered an order\ndenying the Third Motion to Modify on November 6, 2018, and ruled that there was \u201cno\njust cause for modifying the conditions of [Boone\u2019s] supervised release.\u201d See J.A. 104.\nThree days later, on November 9, 2018, Boone noticed this appeal from the district\ncourt\u2019s order denying the Third Motion to Modify. After Boone filed his opening brief,\nthe government sought dismissal of Boone\u2019s appeal based on the appeal waiver in the plea\nagreement.\n7II.\nA.\nWe first assess the government\u2019s appeal waiver contention, which \u2014 if correct \u2014\nwould preclude our consideration of Boone\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s November 6,\n2018 order denying the Third Motion to Modify. We review the validity of Boone\u2019s appeal\nwaiver de novo. See United States v. Thornsbury, 670 F.3d 532, 537 (4th Cir. 2012). We\nhave heretofore explained that, when the government invokes an appeal waiver and \u201cthere\nis no claim that the [g]overnment breached its obligations under the plea agreement, the\nwaiver will be enforced to preclude a defendant from appealing a specific issue if the record\nestablishes that the waiver is valid and the issue being appealed is within [its] scope.\u201d See\nUnited States v. Archie, 771 F.3d 217, 221 (4th Cir. 2014). An appeal waiver is valid if\nthe defendant\u2019s agreement thereto is knowing and intelligent. See United States v.\nManigan, 592 F.3d 621, 627 (4th Cir. 2010).\nIn this proceeding, we are satisfied that Boone\u2019s appeal waiver is valid, as he\nknowingly and intelligently agreed to it. By his signature on the plea agreement, Boone\n\u2014 a sophisticated entrepreneur \u2014 attested that he had reviewed the plea agreement with\nhis lawyers, and that he had understood and voluntarily agreed to its terms. See\nThornsbury, 670 F.3d at 537 (assessing defendant\u2019s background and familiarity with plea\nagreement in ruling that appeal waiver was valid). Crucially, during Boone\u2019s plea hearing,\nthe magistrate judge inquired about the appeal waiver in the plea agreement, and Boone\nconfirmed that he understood it. See id. (\u201cGenerally, if a district court questions a\ndefendant regarding the waiver of appellate rights during the [plea hearing] and the record\n8indicates that the defendant understood the full significance of the waiver, the waiver is\nvalid.\u201d). Thus, we are satisfied that the appeal waiver in Boone\u2019s plea agreement is valid.\nHaving resolved that issue, we will assess whether Boone\u2019s present challenge to the\nDriving Condition is within the scope of the appeal waiver.5\nB.\nWe next consider whether the appeal waiver covers Boone\u2019s appeal from the district\ncourt\u2019s November 6, 2018 order denying the Third Motion to Modify. In that regard, the\ngovernment contends that this appeal falls within the scope of the appeal waiver because it\nconstitutes an appeal from a sentence within the statutory maximum. Additionally, the\ngovernment asserts that it has fulfilled the promises it made to Boone as part of the plea\nagreement and that Boone should now be held to his promises contained therein.\nBoone argues, however, that the appeal waiver is inapplicable to this appeal because\nthe waiver does not encompass an appeal from an order denying a motion to modify\nconditions of supervised release pursued under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2) (authorizing court\n5 The district court advised Boone at the conclusion of the probation revocation\nhearing that he could appeal the court\u2019s rulings, and the court did not mention the appeal\nwaiver. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(j)(1)(B) (providing that district court must advise\ndefendant of right to appeal sentence); United States v. Marsh, 944 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir.\n2019) (ruling that Rule 32(j) requires district court to advise defendant of right to appeal\neven when defendant has agreed to appeal waiver). Given Boone\u2019s sworn assertion during\nthe plea colloquy that he understood the appeal waiver, however, the court\u2019s failure to\nmention the waiver during the probation revocation hearing does not preclude our\nenforcement thereof. See United States v. Lemaster, 403 F.3d 216, 221 (4th Cir. 2005)\n(emphasizing binding nature of statements made during plea colloquy); cf. Manigan, 592\nF.3d at 627-28 (declining to enforce appeal waiver where district court did not mention\nappeal waiver at guilty plea hearing and advised defendant at guilty plea and sentencing\nhearings that he could appeal sentence).\n9to modify supervised release conditions). He further contends that the appeal waiver\nshould not apply here because the Driving Condition is \u201cunreasonable\u201d in light of \u201cthe\nuncontroverted evidence presented to the district court.\u201d See Reply Br. of Appellant 1.\nBecause \u201ca plea agreement is essentially a contract between an accused and the\ngovernment,\u201d we interpret plea agreements using contract law principles. See United\nStates v. Lewis, 633 F.3d 262, 269 (4th Cir. 2011). Pursuant to those principles, we will\n\u201cenforce a plea agreement\u2019s plain language in its ordinary sense.\u201d See United States v.\nJordan, 509 F.3d 191, 195 (4th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). When the\nlanguage of a plea agreement is ambiguous, we construe it against the government. See\nUnited States v. Under Seal, 902 F.3d 412, 417-18 (4th Cir. 2018). We will not, however,\n\u201ccreate an ambiguity [in plea agreement language] where none legitimately exists.\u201d See\nUnited States v. Tate, 845 F.3d 571, 575 (4th Cir. 2017).\n1.\nHere, the plain language of the plea agreement between Boone and the United States\nAttorney provides that Boone waives his right to appeal \u201cany sentence within the statutory\nmaximum . . . on any ground whatsoever.\u201d See Supp. J.A. 4. Boone thus waived his right\nto appeal any sentence that was authorized by law and imposed by the district court for the\noffenses underlying the plea agreement. See Thornsbury, 670 F.3d at 539 (explaining that\nsimilarly worded appeal waiver barred appeal from any legal sentence). We are therefore\nsatisfied that the appeal waiver would encompass an appeal from the court\u2019s September 8,\n2017 order imposing the Driving Condition as a term of supervised release. Two sound\nreasons support that conclusion.\n10First, the statute that governs Boone\u2019s probation revocation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(2),\nauthorizes a district court to \u201crevoke the sentence of probation and resentence the\ndefendant.\u201d Accordingly, at the probation revocation hearing, the district court\nresentenced Boone for the two offenses to which he pleaded guilty (as opposed to\nsentencing him for the violation of the Driving Condition while on probation). See United\nStates v. Schaefer, 120 F.3d 505, 508 (4th Cir. 1997) (explaining resentencing process\nunder \u00a7 3565(a)(2)). The provisions of the plea agreement \u2014 including the appeal waiver\n\u2014 are thus applicable to the sentence imposed at the probation revocation hearing. See\nUnited States v. Jackson, 583 F. App\u2019x 280, 280 (4th Cir. 2014) (applying appeal waiver\nto appeal from sentence imposed at resentencing hearing); United States v. Jones, 538 F.\nApp\u2019x 285, 287 (4th Cir. 2013) (same); see also United States v. Cooney, 875 F.3d 414,\n417 (8th Cir. 2017) (ruling that \u201can appellate waiver bars an appeal after resentencing\u201d and\ncollecting decisions agreeing with that proposition).\nSecond, the waiver of the right to appeal \u201cany sentence\u201d as set forth in the plea\nagreement encompasses challenges to Boone\u2019s supervised release. See, e.g., United States\nv. Copeland, 707 F.3d 522, 525, 530 (4th Cir. 2013) (dismissing appeal contesting length\nof supervised release where defendant waived \u201cright to appeal whatever sentence [was]\nimposed\u201d); United States v. Nguyen, 618 F.3d 72, 74, 76 (1st Cir. 2010) (ruling that waiver\nof right to appeal \u201cany sentence\u201d applies to challenge to supervised release conditions);\nUnited States v. Goodson, 544 F.3d 529, 538 (3d Cir. 2008) (reaching same conclusion\nwhere defendant waived right to appeal his \u201csentence\u201d). Indeed, the plea agreement\nprovides that Boone\u2019s sentence might include a term of supervised release. Accordingly,\n11the Driving Condition falls within the \u201cany sentence\u201d language of the appeal waiver. For\nthose two reasons \u2014 (1) the appeal waiver applies to the sentence fixed at the probation\nrevocation hearing, and (2) the Driving Condition is part of \u201cany sentence\u201d within the\nmeaning of the appeal waiver \u2014 an appeal from the September 8, 2017 order imposing the\nDriving Condition would fall within the appeal waiver.\n2.\nWith that understanding, the question becomes whether Boone presenting his\nchallenge to the Driving Condition in an appeal from the denial of a motion to modify his\nconditions of supervised release allows him to avoid the appeal waiver. And it plainly does\nnot. As the Third Circuit has explained, a ruling otherwise would permit a defendant to\nperform an \u201cend run around\u201d an appeal waiver. See United States v. Wilson, 707 F.3d 412,\n415 n.2 (3d Cir. 2013). For that very reason, courts have concluded \u201cthat an appeal from\na denial of a defendant\u2019s motion . . . to modify the terms of supervised release imposed as\npart of the original sentence falls within the scope of the defendant\u2019s appe[al] waiver.\u201d Id.\n(citing United States v. Scallon, 683 F.3d 680, 681 (5th Cir. 2012) (applying appeal waiver\nto appeal from order denying defendant\u2019s motion to modify supervised release\nconditions)); see also United States v. Damon, 933 F.3d 269, 275 (3d Cir. 2019) (applying\nappeal waiver to appeal from order denying defendant\u2019s motion to terminate supervised\nrelease). We readily agree that a defendant is not entitled to appellate review of a\ncontention that would have been subject to an appeal waiver on direct appeal through some\nprocedural sleight of hand. Because Boone\u2019s appeal waiver would have encompassed an\nappeal from the September 8, 2017 order imposing the Driving Condition, we apply the\n12waiver to this appeal from the district court\u2019s November 6, 2018 order denying the Third\nMotion to Modify.6\nAlthough we will enforce Boone\u2019s appeal waiver, we emphasize that a district\ncourt\u2019s decision to impose a special condition of supervised release (such as the Driving\nCondition) must have some reasonable basis, notwithstanding that such a decision might\nbe unreviewable on appeal as a result of an appeal waiver. See United States v. Dotson,\n324 F.3d 256, 260-61 (4th Cir. 2003) (explaining factors court must assess when imposing\nsupervised release conditions that are additional to statutorily required conditions). And,\neven when a defendant has waived his right to appeal, he generally retains the right to\ncontest a supervised release condition on the ground that the condition is \u201cbased on a\nconstitutionally impermissible factor\u201d or otherwise prohibited by law. See Thornsbury,\n670 F.3d at 539; see also Garza v. Idaho, 139 S. Ct. 738, 745 & n.6 (2019) (specifying\ntypes of claims that courts have concluded may not be waived). Boone has not, however,\npresented any such contention in this appeal.\n6 In rejecting Boone\u2019s attempt to circumvent his appeal waiver, we observe and\nemphasize that he has received all the benefits promised by the government in exchange\nfor the waiver. That is, the government did not prosecute any members of Boone\u2019s family,\nafforded Boone the opportunity to fully cooperate, and advocated for a substantially\nreduced sentence at the initial sentencing hearing of March 20, 2017.\n13III.\nPursuant to the foregoing, we apply the appeal waiver in the plea agreement and\ndismiss this appeal.\nDISMISSED\n14PAMELA HARRIS, Circuit Judge, concurring in the judgment:\nI concur in the dismissal of this appeal because Boone did not file a timely notice of\nappeal from the district court\u2019s order of February 9, 2018, which denied the first of Boone\u2019s\nthree motions seeking the same modification to the conditions of his supervised release on\nthe same grounds. See Fairley v. Fermaint, 482 F.3d 897, 901 (7th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[O]nce a\nconclusive resolution has been reached . . . a renewed motion for the same relief, or a\nbelated request for reconsideration, does not reopen the time for appeal.\u201d).\n15",

Colo.)\nOWNERS INSURANCE COMPANY,\nDefendant Counterclaimant -\nAppellee.\n_________________________________\nORDER AND JUDGMENT*\n_________________________________\nBefore BRISCOE, LUCERO, and EID, Circuit Judges.\n_________________________________\nThis is an insurance case first brought in state court but then removed to\nfederal court under diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. Plaintiff Sunflower\nCondominium Association (Sunflower) filed this action against Owners Insurance\nCompany (Owners) claiming that Owners breached a policy of commercial property\ncoverage and commercial general liability insurance, and also engaged in common\nlaw and statutory bad faith, by failing to fully cover an incident of hail damage that\n* This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines\nof law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for\nits persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.occurred to Sunflower\u2019s condominium complex. Owners filed a counterclaim\nalleging that Sunflower violated the terms of the policy by (a) failing to timely report\nthe hail damage, and (b) submitting a claim and proof of loss that grossly overstated\nthe cost of repairing the hail damage. The district court granted summary judgment\nin favor of Owners on all of Sunflower\u2019s claims. The case then proceeded to trial on\nOwners\u2019 counterclaim, and the jury found in favor of Owners. The district court\nentered final judgment in favor of Owners.\nSunflower now appeals, arguing that the district court (1) erroneously\ninstructed the jury to impute fraudulent intent to Sunflower through the conduct of its\nindependent contractors, (2) erred in denying Sunflower\u2019s Rule 50 motion for\njudgment as a matter of law (JMOL), (3) erred in concluding that the policy afforded\nOwners a recoupment remedy, (4) denied Sunflower a fair trial as the result of two\nerroneous evidentiary rulings, and (5) erred in granting summary judgment in favor\nof Owners on all of Sunflower\u2019s claims. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we reject all of these arguments and affirm the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\nI\nFactual background\nSunflower is a nonprofit, multi-family homeowners association that is\nincorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado. Sunflower oversees twenty-\nthree separate multi-family condominium buildings containing over 100 individual\nhousing units, a clubhouse, and six detached garage buildings (collectively the\n2Sunflower Property). Sunflower has a board of directors comprised of volunteer\nmembers.\nClient Preference Realty & Management, LLC (Client Preference), acting\npursuant to a contract with Sunflower, handled the day-to-day management of the\nSunflower Property. Under the terms of the contract between Sunflower and Client\nPreference, Sunflower agreed to pay Client Preference a 4% special projects fee for\nprojects at the Sunflower Property that cost over $300,000.00.\nIn 2011, Client Preference assigned employee Denyse Countryman to be the\nproperty manager for the Sunflower Property. Countryman did not maintain an\noffice on-site at the Sunflower Property, but instead visited the Sunflower Property\napproximately three times per month. Countryman regularly conducted property\ninspections, but primarily looked for covenant violations during those inspections.\nIn 2013, Sunflower purchased from Owners an insurance policy (the Policy)\nproviding commercial property coverage and commercial general liability coverage.\nThe term of the Policy extended from November 12, 2013, to November 12, 2014.\nOwners, prior to issuing the policy, inspected the Sunflower Property to determine its\ncondition and verify that it was appropriate to insure.\nOn September 29, 2014, a severe wind and hailstorm damaged portions of the\ncommon areas of the Sunflower Property. In particular, the storm resulted in hail\ndamage to roofs, gutters, and screens on the condominium and garage structures.1\n1 According to the record, the Sunflower Property was previously damaged by\nhail storms in June 2009 and June 2012.\n3Countryman was not at the Sunflower Property at the time of the storm and allegedly\nhas no recollection of the storm. Further, Countryman was allegedly not contacted\nafter the storm by anyone at Sunflower regarding property damage sustained during\nthe storm.\nIn April 2015, Countryman hired a roofing contractor, R3NG, Inc. (R3NG), to\nprepare a proposal to fix a leaking roof on one of the individual housing units at the\nSunflower Property. Jason Domecq, the R3NG employee/owner who prepared the\nproposal, observed what appeared to be hail damage on the roof and made a note to\nthat effect in his written proposal, immediately below his detailed descriptions of the\nitems that needed to be repaired. Domecq stated in his note: \u201cThere is evidence of\nhail impacts on both the flat and steep roofs and it is recommended that your\ninsurance company be contacted immediately. You may have a claim.\u201d Restricted\nApp., Vol. 1 at 192. On April 27, 2015, Countryman forwarded R3NG\u2019s proposal to\nevery board member via email, with instructions to review and approve the proposal.\nEvery board member responded to Countryman\u2019s email and approved the proposal.\nOn September 24, 2015, Countryman was at the Sunflower Property and\nobserved damage to downspouts and window trims. Countryman contacted Adjusters\nInternational Matrix Business Consulting (Matrix) to inspect the Sunflower Property\nand determine the extent and cause of the damages. On October 7, 2015,\nCountryman met a Matrix employee, Fred Mahe, at the Sunflower Property for\npurposes of conducting an inspection. Mahe concluded that there was significant hail\ndamage to the Sunflower Property that needed to be repaired.\n4At a board meeting in late October of 2015, Countryman presented the\ninformation she had received from Matrix and received approval from the Board to\nhire Matrix and proceed with filing a claim with Owners for the hail damage. On\nNovember 19, 2015, the Board met and executed a written contract with Matrix.\nUnder the terms of that contract, Matrix was to receive 10% of any amount paid by\nOwners to Sunflower.\nCountryman in turn hired R3NG to help Matrix establish the scope of the\ndamage and the amount of the claim to be submitted to Owners. Countryman agreed,\non behalf of Sunflower, to pay R3NG for its work.\nDave Ford, a public adjuster employed by Matrix, worked together with\nDomecq from R3NG to prepare a proof of loss for the Sunflower Property. Together,\nFord and Domecq estimated that the cost of repairing the hail damage to the\nSunflower Property was approximately 1.8 million dollars.\nOn December 20, 2015, Sunflower notified its insurance agent regarding the\ndamages resulting from the storm. Owners, after learning of the damages, responded\nby hiring an independent adjuster named Gary Stevens. Stevens met Ford at the\nSunflower Property and, after examining the Sunflower Property, agreed on the scope\nof damage that was sustained by the Sunflower Property.\nOn May 4, 2016, Ford sent Owners a \u201cSworn Statement In Proof of Loss\u201d that\nincluded the estimate that was prepared by Ford and Domecq. Sondra Kalcevic, the\nboard president, signed the statement. The statement alleged that the loss occurred\n5\u201cabout the 29th day of September 2014\u201d due to \u201cWind and Hail.\u201d ECF No. 94, Exh.\nM at 5.\nAfter receiving Sunflower\u2019s statement, Owners hired an engineer and a\nbuilding consultant to assist in reviewing the statement. The engineer inspected the\nSunflower property and found hail damage to several of the roofs. She was allegedly\nunable, however, to determine when the hail damage occurred. More specifically,\nshe could not differentiate between hail damage from the September 2014 storm and\nprior hail storms in 2009 and 2012.\nStevens, the independent adjuster hired by Owners, ultimately concluded that\nthe replacement cost value of the damage to the Sunflower Property was\n$857,233.89, and that the actual cash value was $590,458.91. In August 2016,\nOwners made a payment of $515,458.10 to Sunflower in an attempt to resolve the\nclaim. This payment represented the actual cash value estimated by Stevens, minus\nSunflower\u2019s $75,000 deductible. In April 2017, Owners made an additional payment\nto Sunflower in the amount of $92,000.00.\nProcedural background\nOn September 28, 2016, Sunflower filed a complaint against Owners in\nColorado state district court. The first claim for relief alleged that Owners breached\nthe insurance contract by failing to pay Sunflower for all damages it sustained from\nthe September 29, 2014 storm. The second claim for relief sought a declaratory\njudgment regarding Sunflower\u2019s right to \u201ccoverage for the cost of necessary repairs\nto [the Sunflower Property] less the applicable deductible.\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 1 at 54.\n6On December 2, 2016, Owners removed the case to the United States District\nCourt for the District of Colorado on the basis of diversity of citizenship.\nSunflower amended its complaint three times after removal. The third\namended complaint included the original claims for breach of contract and\ndeclaratory judgment, and included two new claims: statutory bad faith under Colo.\nRev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 10-3-1115, -1116, and common law insurance bad faith.\nOwners, in its answer to the third amended complaint, asserted as a defense\nthat Sunflower\u2019s claims were \u201cbarred in whole or in part as a result of [Sunflower\u2019s]\nmisrepresentations, false statements, and non-cooperation with Owners.\u201d ECF\nNo. 66 at 8. This defense relied on provisions of the Policy that precluded coverage\nin the event that the insured concealed or misrepresented a material fact or otherwise\ncommitted fraud (hereinafter Fraud Clauses). The first of those Fraud Clauses stated:\n\u201cThis Coverage Part [i.e., Commercial Property coverage] is void in any case of\nfraud by you as it relates to this Coverage Part at any time. It is also void if you or\nany other insured, at any time, intentionally conceal or misrepresent a material fact\n. . . .\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 20 at 5700. A related provision likewise stated, in pertinent\npart: \u201cWe will not pay for any loss or damage in any case of: 1. Concealment or\nmisrepresentation or a material fact; or 2. Fraud committed by you or any other\ninsured (\u2018insured\u2019) at any time and relating to coverage under this policy.\u201d Id.\nat 5718. Owners alleged that Sunflower violated the Fraud Clauses by\nmisrepresenting the date when it first learned of the hail damage to the Property, and\nalso by misrepresenting the amount needed to repair the damage. Owners also\n7asserted, in pertinent part, a counterclaim against Sunflower for breach of the Fraud\nClauses.\nThe parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. Sunflower moved for\npartial summary judgment with respect to Owners\u2019 concealment, misrepresentation or\nfraud defense and Owners\u2019 counterclaims for fraud and recoupment. Sunflower\nargued that Owners could not prove that the date Sunflower had alleged it first\ndiscovered the hail damage was false, or that Sunflower intended Owners to take any\nspecific action as a result of the date of discovery. Sunflower also argued that\nOwners could not prove that the R3NG/Ford estimate of damages was a material fact\nor that Owners was ignorant of its falsity. Owners, for its part, moved for summary\njudgment with respect to all of Sunflower\u2019s claims.\nOn May 14, 2018, the district court issued a written order addressing both\nmotions for summary judgment. The district court denied Sunflower\u2019s motion for\nsummary judgment on Owners\u2019 counterclaims in its entirety. In doing so, the district\ncourt concluded that, as to the alleged untimely reporting of the insurance claims,\nOwners\u2019 ignorance of the falsity of Sunflower\u2019s date of discovery was not an element\nof Owners\u2019 claim that Sunflower violated the Policy\u2019s Fraud Clauses. The district\ncourt further concluded that the date Sunflower actually discovered the damage was\n\u201c\u2018reasonably relevant\u2019 to [Owners\u2019] investigation, given that it form[ed] the basis of\n[Owners\u2019] late notice claim,\u201d and \u201cthat \u2018reasonable minds could differ\u2019 regarding the\nmateriality of the misrepresentations.\u201d ECF No. 149 at 10-11. The district court also\nconcluded that, based upon the evidence before it, \u201ca reasonable jury could find that\n8[Sunflower] knowingly and deliberately misrepresented the date of discovery to\n[Owners], implying that [Sunflower] acted with the intent to deceive.\u201d Id. at 11.\nAs for Owners\u2019 defense and counterclaim that Sunflower knowingly\nmisrepresented the cost of repairing the damages in its proof of loss, the district court\nconcluded it was immaterial whether, in fact, Owners attached any importance to\nSunflower\u2019s estimate. Instead, the district court concluded the question was\n\u201cwhether a reasonable insurance company would attach importance to the matter.\u201d\nId. at 12. The district court concluded that \u201ca reasonable jury could find that a\nreasonable insurance company could attach importance to [Sunflower\u2019s] cost of\nrepair estimate.\u201d Id. The district court rejected as immaterial Sunflower\u2019s argument\nthat Owners was long wary of the truthfulness of Sunflower\u2019s estimate. And,\nultimately, the district court denied Sunflower\u2019s motion for summary judgment after\nconcluding that genuine issues of material fact existed that precluded granting\nsummary judgment on this defense/counterclaim.\nAs for Owners\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court first\nconcluded that \u201ca reasonably diligent property manager\u201d in Countryman\u2019s position\n\u201cwould have read the e-mail [from Domecq regarding the hail damage] at the time it\nwas received,\u201d and that, consequently, Sunflower \u201cwas on notice of the damage\u201d at\nthe time Countryman \u201creceived Domecq\u2019s \u201cApril 2015 e-mail\u201d and \u201cthe prompt\nnotice provision [of the Policy] was [also] triggered.\u201d Id. at 16. The district court\nfurther concluded \u201cthat no reasonable jury could find that [Owners] waived its late\nnotice defense.\u201d Id. at 17. The district court also concluded that Owners \u201cmet its\n9burden to show that it was prejudiced by the delayed notice\u201d from Sunflower. Id.\nat 20. The district court thus concluded that \u201cthere [wa]s no genuine issue of\nmaterial fact that [Sunflower] violated the notice-prejudice rule\u201d and that,\nconsequently, Owners was entitled to summary judgment in its favor \u201cwith respect to\n[Sunflower\u2019s] breach of contract claims.\u201d Id. at 21. The district court also concluded\nthat, because Sunflower\u2019s breach of contract claims failed, Owners was entitled to\nsummary judgment with respect to Sunflower\u2019s bad faith claims as well.\nOn October 15, 2018, the case proceeded to trial on Owners\u2019 counterclaim for\nbreach of the Fraud Clauses. After hearing five days of evidence, the jury found in\nfavor of Owners on its counterclaim.\nFinal judgment in the case was entered on November 15, 2018. The judgment\nstated, in pertinent part: \u201cjudgment is entered in favor of Defendant-Counterclaimant\nOwners Insurance Company and against Plaintiff-Counterclaim Defendant Sunflower\nCondominium Association, Inc., in the principal amount of $608,409.96 with\nprejudgment interest of $105,352.18, for a total of $713,762.14, with post-judgment\ninterest at the federal statutory rate of 1.52% until paid.\u201d ECF No. 237 at 1.\nSunflower filed a timely notice of appeal.\nII\nSunflower raises five issues on appeal. We conclude, as discussed in greater\ndetail below, that all five issues lack merit. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of\nthe district court.\n101) Did the district court err in instructing the jury to impute fraudulent\nintent to Sunflower through the conduct of R3NG and Domecq?\nIn its first issue on appeal, Sunflower argues that the district court erred in\ninstructing the jury to impute fraudulent intent to Sunflower through the conduct of\nR3NG and Domecq, both of whom Sunflower refers to as its independent contractors.\nSunflower asserts that \u201c[t]he lynchpin of Owners\u2019 counter-claim [wa]s that Sunflower\nbreached the contract\u2019s fraud clause by offering what Owners claims was an\nintentionally inflated estimate.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 29. As noted, the Policy\u2019s Fraud\nClauses stated, in pertinent part, that the commercial property coverage portion of the\nPolicy was \u201cvoid in any case of fraud by you as it relates to this Coverage Part at any\ntime. It is also void if you or any other insured, at any time, intentionally conceal or\nmisrepresent a material fact . . . .\u201d Aplt. App., Vol. 20 at 5700. Sunflower argues\nthat, because this policy language makes no reference to \u201cagents\u201d of the insured, it is\ntherefore limited to concealments or misrepresentations made directly by Sunflower.\nSunflower argues that \u201cOwners\u2019 entire counter-claim, however, turned on Owners\u2019\nargument that Sunflower\u2019s agents fraudulently inflated the Ford/R3NG Estimate.\u201d\nAplt. Br. at 30 (emphasis in original). Sunflower in turn argues that \u201cOwners did not\nintroduce evidence that anyone at Sunflower, its management, or its own employees\nwere aware the independent adjuster or roofers had falsely inflated the estimate.\u201d Id.\n\u201cConsequently,\u201d Sunflower argues, \u201cOwners insisted upon and received numerous\ninstructions that the jury should impute the intent of any \u2018agent\u2019 appointed to act on\nbehalf of Sunflower to Sunflower.\u201d Id. \u201cFurther,\u201d Sunflower argues, \u201cthe court\n11expressly instructed the jury to consider Matrix and Ford the legal agents of\nSunflower and to impute Ford\u2019s state of mind and intent to Sunflower as a matter of\nlaw, regardless of whether Sunflower was actually aware the Ford/R[3]NG Estimate\nwas intentionally inflated.\u201d Id. \u201cThough the court\u2019s instructions did not expressly\ntell the jury to consider R3NG an \u2018agent\u2019 of Sunflower,\u201d Sunflower argues \u201cthere\nwere several instructions on agency that allowed the jury to impute the knowledge\nand intent of the third-party roofing contractor to Sunflower as well.\u201d Id.\nIn order to properly address Sunflower\u2019s arguments regarding the instructions,\nit is necessary to review the history of the district court proceedings and several\nrelated rulings made by the district court. Owners, in its answer to the Sunflower\u2019s\nthird amended complaint, asserted, as both an affirmative defense and a\ncounterclaim, that Sunflower violated the Fraud Clauses of the Policy by knowingly\nmisrepresenting the costs of repairing the hail damage. Sunflower filed a written\nreply to that counterclaim and asserted a number of affirmative defenses, but did not\nallege that the Fraud Clauses were limited strictly to actions taken by Sunflower and\nits employees, as opposed to its agents.\nWhen Sunflower moved for summary judgment in October of 2017, it\nmaintained that Owners \u201cha[d] not paid the full amount of . . . damages\u201d that was\nowed to Sunflower under the Policy, and it argued that Owners could not \u201cprovide\nevidence\u201d to support its counterclaim \u201cthat Sunflower . . . committed fraud against\nOwners.\u201d ECF No. 93 at 1. More specifically, Sunflower argued that Owners could\nnot \u201cprove either that the R3NG/Ford estimate [wa]s a material fact, or that Owners\n12was ignorant of its falsity.\u201d Id. at 8. Sunflower asserted in support that Owners\nattached no importance to the R3NG estimate, and it further asserted that \u201cOwners\nwas aware, since before it paid the undisputed payment, that it did not trust the\nestimate submitted by Sunflower.\u201d Id. at 9. Nowhere in its summary judgment\nmotion, however, did Sunflower argue that the Policy\u2019s Fraud Clauses were limited\nby their language to actions committed by Sunflower, nor, for that matter, did\nSunflower make any other arguments regarding agency (e.g., that R3NG and Domecq\nwere independent contractors and not agents of Sunflower).\nApproximately four months later, in early March 2018, the parties met with the\nmagistrate judge to prepare the final pretrial order. Owners asserted in the final\npretrial order, as both a defense and a counterclaim, that Sunflower \u201call but\nencouraged its authorized agents to commit insurance fraud\u201d by submitting a\nknowingly inflated proof of loss to Owners. ECF No. 131 at 6. Sunflower, for its\npart, asserted that Owners did not rely on, and indeed effectively ignored, the proof\nof loss submitted by R3NG and Matrix on Sunflower\u2019s behalf. Nowhere, however,\ndid Sunflower assert that Owners\u2019 agency theory was precluded by the language of\nthe Fraud Clauses, nor did Sunflower otherwise assert that there were any pending\nissues regarding agency.\nOn September 17, 2018, approximately one month prior to trial, the parties\nfiled three sets of proposed jury instructions. Included among Sunflower\u2019s proposed\njury instructions was an instruction defining the term \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and\neffectively asking the jury to determine whether R3NG and/or Matrix were\n13independent contractors. ECF No. 164 at 10. Nowhere in this proposed instruction\nwas the term \u201cagent\u201d defined or even mentioned. Likewise, Sunflower\u2019s proposed\nverdict form contained no mention of the word agent. And, again, Sunflower made\nno mention of the Policy strictly limiting fraudulent conduct to Sunflower alone.\nOwners\u2019 set of proposed jury instructions included a number of instructions\nthat addressed agency. For example, Owners\u2019 proposed instruction I described how\nan agency relationship is created and defined the terms agent and principal. ECF\nNo. 167 at 14. There was also a proposed instruction on the apparent authority of an\nagent, another stating that any misrepresentations or omissions made by an agent are\ndeemed misstatements or omissions of the principal, and, finally, an instruction\nstating that Matrix, Ford, Client Preference, Countryman, R3NG, Domecq, and every\nboard member were agents of Sunflower. Id. at 15\u201316. Although the caption of\nOwners\u2019 proposed instructions stated they were \u201cDISPUTED,\u201d Owners did not\nidentify Sunflower\u2019s precise objection to the instructions, nor did Sunflower file a\nwritten objection to Owners\u2019 proposed instructions.\nLastly, Owners filed what it described as a set of proposed stipulated jury\ninstructions. One of those instructions stated that \u201c[a]n agent is acting within the\nscope of its authority when the agent is carrying on business for its principal which\nthe principal has expressly authorized or which is within the incidental, implied, or\napparent authority of the agent.\u201d ECF No. 166 at 4. Others discussed incidental and\nimplied authority of an agent. Id. at 5. The final stipulated proposed instruction\nstated that \u201c[a] principal is considered to know or have notice of information if the\n14principal\u2019s agent, while acting within the scope of the agent\u2019s authority, learns or\nreceives notice of the information.\u201d Id. at 7.\nThe case proceeded to trial on October 15, 2018. At the close of Owners\u2019\ncase-in-chief, Sunflower moved for JMOL, arguing that (a) policyholders may legally\npresent inaccurate proofs of loss without conscious dishonesty or intent to defraud,\nand (b) that Owners\u2019 evidence failed to establish that Sunflower submitted a\nknowingly inflated proof of loss. With respect to this latter argument, Sunflower\nasserted that Owners presented the testimony of its independent adjuster Gary\nStevens, and that Stevens never talked to Ford or Domecq, the two people who\nprepared Sunflower\u2019s proof of loss. Again, however, Sunflower made no mention of\nany issues regarding agency. The district court took Sunflower\u2019s motion for JMOL\nunder advisement.\nSunflower presented the testimony of three witnesses in defense of Owners\u2019\ncounterclaim: Countryman, Edward Fronapfel, an engineer who was hired by\nSunflower during the litigation to assess the property and determine if the damages\nwere caused by the September 29, 2014 hail storm, and Domecq. Countryman\nconceded on cross-examination that Matrix was speaking for Sunflower when it\nsubmitted the claim for damages to Owners and that Sunflower could not \u201cpass the\nbuck\u201d by claiming that it did not know of any misrepresentations in the proof of loss.\nAplt. App., Vol. 19 at 4999. She also conceded that, under the terms of the contract\nbetween Sunflower and Client Preference, Client Preference was to receive a \u201cspecial\nprojects fee\u201d of 4% of the gross amount of the total cost of repairs to the Sunflower\n15Property, and that she personally would receive 35% of that 4% special projects fee.\nId. at 5001. Domecq, for his part, had no explanation for numerous categories of\ndamages alleged in the proof of loss and, on several occasions, conceded that certain\ncharges listed in the proof of loss were unjustified. He also contradicted his\ndeposition testimony on multiple occasions. Ultimately, and perhaps most damaging\nto Sunflower, Domecq conceded that the multiple errors that Owners identified in his\nproof of loss could reasonably suggest that the errors were intentional rather than\nrandom. Id. at 5348.\nAt the close of all the evidence, Sunflower renewed its motion for JMOL and\nargued, for the first time ever in the proceedings, that the Policy required that any\nconcealment, misrepresentation or fraud have been committed directly by the insured,\nand not by the insured\u2019s agents. Id., Vol. 20 at 5371. Sunflower in turn argued that\nOwners presented no evidence that \u201canyone on behalf of Sunflower . . . was involved\nwhatsoever in the conduct which is the . . . inflation of the estimate.\u201d Id. at 5373.\nThe district court responded: \u201cWhat you\u2019re effectively asking me to rule as a matter\nof law that the only way\u201d that Owners\u2019 \u201ccounterclaim goes to the jury is if I rule as a\nmatter of law that the intentional misrepresentation or concealment could only have\nbeen done by Sunflower and none of its agents.\u201d Id. at 5373\u201374. Sunflower\u2019s\ncounsel responded: \u201cCorrect.\u201d Id. at 5374. The district court then stated: \u201cCan I ask\nyou why you\u2019ve waited to this point to raise this issue?\u201d Id. Sunflower\u2019s counsel\nresponded: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of waiting as much as a matter of discovering\nit as we were doing more research, Your Honor.\u201d Id. Owners\u2019 counsel argued, in\n16part, that Sunflower had waived these arguments by failing to raise them at an earlier\nstage of the proceedings. Id. at 5377. The district court noted that Sunflower was\n\u201cspringing this on me at the last moment.\u201d Id. at 5384. Consequently, the district\ncourt took the matter under advisement and directed the parties to file supplemental\nbriefs addressing the issue raised by Sunflower, including whether Sunflower had\nwaived or forfeited the issue that Sunflower could only be liable for concealment,\nmisrepresentation or fraud that it committed.\nOwners also moved for JMOL on the issue of whether Matrix, Ford, Client\nPreference, Countryman, R3NG and Domecq were Sunflower\u2019s agents as a matter of\nlaw such that their statements in relation to the insurance claim and proof of loss\nwere binding on Sunflower. Id. at 5391. The district court concluded, as a matter of\nlaw, that Client Preference, Matrix and Ford were agents of Sunflower. Id. at\n5418-20. But the district court concluded that genuine issues of material fact existed\nregarding whether R3NG and Domecq were agents of Sunflower. Id. at 5421. Thus,\nthe district court granted in part and denied in part Owners\u2019 motion for JMOL.\nAt the end of the fourth day of trial, shortly after the parties made their oral\nJMOL motions, the district court conducted an instruction conference. During that\nconference, Sunflower objected to the district court\u2019s proposed instructions regarding\nagency, which included instructions on agency relationship, scope of authority,\nincidental authority, implied authority, apparent authority, and knowledge imputed to\nprincipal. Sunflower argued: \u201cThe basis for the objection is that under the explicit\nterms of the contract [i.e., the Policy], Owners must prove that Sunflower breached\n17the fraud provision, not anything related to one of its agents. What Sunflower\u2019s\nagents did or didn\u2019t do are entirely unrelated to this case.\u201d Id. at 5440. The district\ncourt took that objection under advisement.\nThe next morning, on the fifth and final day of trial, Sunflower filed its brief in\nsupport of its renewed motion for JMOL, and also filed objections to the district\ncourt\u2019s proposed agency instructions. Sunflower argued in its brief that, \u201c[a]ccording\nto the plain language of the Policy, Owners must prove that Sunflower, rather than its\nagents, violated the fraud clause,\u201d and that \u201cOwners ha[d] failed to present any\nevidence at trial that Sunflower intentionally misrepresented either the amount of the\nloss by submitting an inflated claim, or the date of loss.\u201d ECF No. 218 at 1. \u201cAs a\nresult,\u201d Sunflower argued, it \u201cshould be granted judgment as a matter of law on\nOwners\u2019 claim for Breach of Contract.\u201d Id.\nThe district court denied Sunflower\u2019s renewed motion for JMOL and overruled\nits objections to the proposed agency instructions. In doing so, the district court\nconcluded that \u201cSunflower\u2019s written submission entirely fail[ed] to address the\nwaiver question that the Court and Owners repeatedly raised during oral argument on\nthe motion,\u201d and \u201cthus deem[ed] Sunflower to have conceded the issue.\u201d ECF\nNo. 231 at 2. The district court also concluded that, in any event, Sunflower forfeited\nits arguments by failing to raise them \u201cat an appropriate time.\u201d Id. at 3. Had\nSunflower raised its arguments at an earlier stage, the district court noted, it might\n\u201chave obviated most of the testimony and evidence presented at trial.\u201d Id. The\ndistrict court concluded \u201cit would be fundamentally unjust to put Owners to its proof\n18on its counterclaim at a week-long jury trial, and then consider at this late date\narguments from Sunflower which, if now accepted by the Court, would render the\nentire trial a nullity.\u201d Id. In sum, the district court concluded \u201cthat Sunflower\nforfeited both arguments,\u201d i.e., that agency principles did not apply and that\nrecoupment was not a remedy allowed under the Policy, \u201cfor failure to timely raise\nthem before trial.\u201d Id.\nSunflower\u2019s opening appellate brief entirely ignores this procedural history\nand, more significantly, the district court\u2019s forfeiture ruling. We have long and\nconsistently held that \u201c[a]n issue or argument [that is] insufficiently raised in the\nopening brief is deemed waived.\u201d Becker v. Kroll, 494 F.3d 904, 913 n.6 (10th Cir.\n2007); see Bronson v. Swensen, 500 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201c[W]e\nroutinely have declined to consider arguments that are not raised, or are inadequately\npresented, in an appellant\u2019s opening brief.\u201d). Adhering to this rule, we conclude that\nSunflower has effectively waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s forfeiture\nruling regarding the agency instructions by failing to acknowledge or challenge that\nruling in its opening appellate brief.\n2) Did the district court err in denying Sunflower\u2019s Rule 50 motion?\nIn its second issue on appeal, Sunflower challenges the district court\u2019s denial\nof its motion for JMOL at the close of all the evidence, arguing that there was no\nevidence that it intentionally misrepresented or concealed a material fact, aside from\nerroneously imputing the acts of its independent \u201cagents.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 34.\nAccording to Sunflower, \u201cthe only reason the many instructions on \u2018agency\u2019 were\n19included in the charge was because there was otherwise nothing showing Sunflower\nitself \u2018intentionally\u2019 misrepresented the amount of the loss.\u201d Id. (emphasis in\noriginal). \u201cThus,\u201d Sunflower argues, \u201cthis case presents the secondary problem that\nthe only evidentiary basis the jury could have relied on for finding a breach of\ncontract by Sunflower was the intent of persons or entities other than Sunflower,\nwhich . . . is not supported by the contractual language as a matter of law.\u201d Id. at\n34-35 (emphasis in original). \u201cUnder these circumstances,\u201d Sunflower argues, this\n\u201cCourt should reverse and render a take nothing judgment on Owners\u2019 counter-claim\nbecause there is legally insufficient evidence Sunflower or \u2018another insured\u2019\n\u2018intentionally\u2019 violated the fraud clause.\u201d Id. at 35.\nSunflower\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for JMOL is,\nat bottom, essentially the same as Sunflower\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s agency\ninstructions. Specifically, Sunflower is asserting that it was entitled to JMOL\nbecause (a) the plain language of the Policy\u2019s Fraud Clauses limited the scope of\nthose clauses to actions taken directly by Sunflower and its employees, and does not\napply to actions taken by agents working on behalf of Sunflower, such as R3NG and\nDomecq, and (b) Owners presented no evidence at trial establishing that Sunflower or\nits employees were responsible for the misrepresentations contained in the proof of\nloss. As discussed above, however, Sunflower fails in its opening appellate brief to\naddress the district court\u2019s conclusion that it forfeited these arguments by failing to\nraise them in a timely fashion prior to trial. We therefore conclude that, as with its\n20challenge to the district court\u2019s instructions on agency, Sunflower has effectively\nwaived any challenge it may have to the district court\u2019s forfeiture ruling.\n3) Does the Policy provide a recoupment remedy?\nIn its third issue on appeal, Sunflower argues that the Policy does not provide\nany recoupment remedy, and thus does not allow Owners to recoup the amounts that\nit paid to Sunflower. In other words, Sunflower argues that Owners \u201cseeks to insert a\nremedy into the Policy that it does not provide \u2013 return or recoupment of an\nUndisputed Payment the insurer already made on a claim.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 40.\nSunflower argues that \u201c[t]his is not just a waiver problem,\u201d but also \u201ca basic contract\ninterpretation problem\u201d and \u201c[t]he remedy provided by the District Court is not in the\nPolicy.\u201d Id. at 41. Sunflower in turn argues that we \u201cmust interpret the Policy\nlanguage as written resolving any ambiguity in favor of the insured under the well-\nestablished rules\u201d governing contracts of insurance. Id.\nNotably, Sunflower makes no attempt to identify what ruling of the district\ncourt it is actually challenging. As previously discussed, Sunflower first argued that\nthe Policy does not allow for recoupment when it renewed its motion for JMOL at the\nclose of all the evidence. The district court concluded that Sunflower had forfeited\nthis argument by failing to raise it in a timely fashion prior to trial.\nBecause Sunflower once again fails to acknowledge, let alone directly\nchallenge, the district court\u2019s forfeiture ruling in its opening brief, we conclude that\nSunflower has effectively waived any challenge to that ruling. See Becker, 494 F.3d\n21at 913 n.6 (\u201cAn issue or argument [that is] insufficiently raised in the opening brief is\ndeemed waived.\u201d).\n4) Did the district court deny Sunflower a fair trial as a result of two\nevidentiary rulings?\nIn its fourth issue on appeal, Sunflower argues that it was denied a fair trial as\na result of the district court\u2019s decision to (a) admit contractor\u2019s invoices and bids that\nwere prepared before the 2014 storm, and (b) exclude evidence of Owners\u2019\ninvestigation of Sunflower\u2019s claim. We review for abuse of discretion the trial\ncourt\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Ryan Dev. Co., L.C. v. Ind. Lumbermens Mut. Ins. Co.,\n711 F.3d 1165, 1170 (10th Cir. 2013).\na) Admission of contractor\u2019s bids and invoices\nDuring Owners\u2019 case-in-chief, the district court permitted Geoffrey Page, a\nsenior claims adjuster employed by Owners, to testify about the amounts of written\nbids and invoices that Sunflower received from roofing contractors in 2007. Those\nbids and invoices, which were prepared approximately seven years prior to the storm\nthat caused the damage claimed by Sunflower in this case, related to various roof\nrepairs at the Sunflower Property. Page also testified that he used Xactimate\nsoftware2 to change Sunflower\u2019s 2016 estimate of damages resulting from the 2014\nstorm to reflect 2007 pricing and in turn gave that altered pricing report to Gary\n2 According to the record, Xactimate software is commonly used by\ncontractors and insurance adjusters to determine the cost of repairs.\n22Stevens, the independent adjuster who was hired by Owners to review Sunflower\u2019s\nproof of loss and estimate in this case.\nStevens also testified about the 2007 bids and invoices. Stevens explained\nthat, as part of his investigation in this case, he attempted to determine how much the\nrepairs requested by Sunflower in its proof of loss would have cost in 2007 dollars.\nStevens contrasted the amounts requested by Sunflower from Owners, adjusted to\nreflect 2007 pricing, with the amounts contained in the bids and invoices that\nSunflower actually received from contractors in 2007. Stevens testified that he had\nnever before seen such a \u201cmassive\u201d difference in prices, i.e., the difference between\nthe amounts that Sunflower actually paid for roof repairs in 2007 and the amounts\nthat Sunflower requested from Owners in 2016. Aplt. App., Vol. 18 at 4813.\nAlthough Sunflower objected to the admission of the 2007 bids and invoices,\nthe district court overruled that objection and admitted them for the limited purpose\nof serving as \u201cevidence of Sunflower\u2019s notice of the amount it was invoiced to\nreplace the roofs in 2007 and Sunflower\u2019s willingness to pay such price.\u201d ECF\nNo. 225 at 13 (jury instructions). The district court specifically instructed the jury\nregarding the limited purpose of this evidence. Id.\nSunflower argues in its appeal that, contrary to the district court\u2019s limiting\ninstruction, the 2007 \u201cinvoices/bids were intended to be used\u2014and were exclusively\nused\u2014as proof of the alleged \u2018truth\u2019 stated in them: that the roofs were less\nexpensive to repair at a previous time in order to have the jury compare them to the\nFord/R3NG Estimate.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 48. Sunflower in turn argues that \u201cthe\n23invoices/bids were completely irrelevant and highly prejudicial.\u201d Id. at 49.\nSunflower asserts that \u201cthe invoices/bids lack[ed] any detail about the itemized\nmaterials costs, labor costs and other critical elements necessary to make a\ncomparison to the detailed Xactimate estimate they were used to attack.\u201d Id.\n\u201cAdditionally,\u201d Sunflower argues, \u201cthey were not related to Storm damage because\nthey predated the [2014] Storm entirely.\u201d Id. Sunflower also argues that the limiting\ninstruction given to the jury by the district court \u201cfailed to cure [the] prejudice\u201d that\nresulted from the documents\u2019 admission. Id. at 50. Sunflower asserts that \u201c[o]nce\nthe court allowed Owners to publish the numbers from these bids and invoices to the\njury and invited its witnesses and the jury to speculate about their relevance to the\ncost of repairs for damage from the Storm, that comparison permeated the entire\ncase.\u201d Id. Thus, Sunflower argues, \u201cthe admission of such irrelevant and prejudicial\nevidence and its extensive use throughout the case demonstrates reversible harm just\nfrom the admission of this evidence.\u201d Id. at 51.\nWe reject Sunflower\u2019s arguments and conclude that the district court acted\nwithin its discretion in admitting the 2007 bids and invoices for the limited purpose\noutlined in its instruction to the jury. In admitting this evidence, the district court\nnoted that Sunflower \u201cfailed to explain why [Owners\u2019] proposal to have Gary Stevens\nexplain how to compare the estimates [wa]s improper.\u201d ECF No. 204 at 7. The\ndistrict court also explained that Sunflower was \u201cfree to challenge [Stevens\u2019]\ncomparison technique on cross examination,\u201d and it therefore agreed with Owners\n\u201cthat [Sunflower\u2019s] argument [went] to the weight attributable to the proffered\n24testimony, but d[id] not preclude its admission altogether.\u201d Id. Notably, Sunflower\nmakes no mention of these rationales in its opening appellate brief.\nEven assuming, for purposes of argument, that the district court abused its\ndiscretion by admitting the 2007 bids and invoices, it is clear that the admission of\nthis evidence was harmless in light of the evidence presented at trial by both Owners\nand Sunflower. For its part, Owners presented extensive testimony from Stevens, the\nindependent adjuster it hired to review Sunflower\u2019s proof of loss. Stevens testified,\nindependent of the evidence of the 2007 bids and invoices, about multiple categories\nof items in Sunflower\u2019s proof of loss that, based upon his experience and expertise,\nwere inflated and unreasonably excessive. Sunflower, during its case, presented\ntestimony from Jason Domecq of R3NG, one of the two people who prepared and\nsubmitted the proof of loss on behalf of Sunflower. As previously discussed,\nDomecq proved to be a disastrous witness for Sunflower. Domecq offered no\nexplanation for numerous line items contained in the proof of loss. He also, on\nseveral occasions, conceded that certain charges listed in the proof of loss were\nunjustified. And, perhaps most surprisingly, he conceded that the multiple errors that\nStevens identified in the proof of loss could reasonably indicate that the errors were\nintentional rather than random. Thus, the 2007 bids and invoices were but a small\npart of the evidence supporting Owners\u2019 counterclaim for fraud and\nmisrepresentation.\nb) Exclusion of evidence of Owners\u2019 investigation of Sunflower\u2019s claim\n25Sunflower also asserts that the district court abused its discretion by\n\u201cexclud[ing] evidence of [three] detailed reports prepared by Stevens for Owners\nrelated to the Storm damage, which would have been relevant for the jury to conduct\nan apples-to-apples comparison.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 51. Owners objected to admission of\nthese reports on the grounds that they went \u201cto the claims handling\u201d issues raised by\nSunflower \u201cthat the [district court] ha[d] already\u201d resolved. Aplt. App., Vol. 18\nat 4747. Sunflower argued in response that the reports were relevant for purposes of\nimpeaching Stevens. Id. at 4749. The district court sustained Owners\u2019 objection\n\u201cbecause [the reports] [we]re matters directly [involving] the claims handling,\u201d but it\ninformed Sunflower that it \u201cw[ould] allow in a limited form [the reports] to be used\nas potential impeachment of . . . Stevens\u201d (i.e., without actually admitting the\nreports). Id.\nSunflower cross-examined Page, Owners\u2019 senior claims adjuster, about eleven\nitems that Stevens failed to include in his initial estimate of damages. Id. at 4750\u201351.\nDuring that cross-examination, Page conceded that Stevens had to prepare a revised\nestimate to incorporate those eleven items and that the revised estimate was greater\nthan the initial estimate. Id. at 4751\u201352. During Sunflower\u2019s cross-examination of\nStevens, it did not ask him similar questions, nor did it otherwise attempt to impeach\nhim using any of the three reports that were excluded by the district court. At the\nconclusion of Sunflower\u2019s cross-examination of Stevens, the district court stated on\nthe record: \u201cBecause the case law is clear that documents can be used for\nimpeachment purposes that have not been received into evidence, I am not precluding\n26you [Sunflower] from using any of the exhibits you referenced in your offer of proof\nor any of the exhibits . . . as to which I\u2019ve sustained objections . . . in an appropriate\nattempt to impeach a witness provided that the foundation has been laid.\u201d Id.\nat 4923\u201324. Thereafter, Sunflower made an offer of proof to the district court\nregarding the excluded exhibits. Sunflower stated that its \u201coffer of proof relate[d] to\ncross-examination of Gary Stevens,\u201d and that \u201c[h]ad [it] been allowed, [it] would\nhave introduced evidence of Exhibits 71, 76, and 80,\u201d which \u201cwere various\ndocuments that were prepared by . . . Stevens while he was serving as independent\nadjuster during the claims process. They were a status report, a reserve report, and\nthen what he\u2019s referred to as a closing report.\u201d Id. at 4930. Sunflower in turn stated\nthat those reports \u201cwould have been significant\u201d because \u201cthey talk[ed] about, on\nmultiple occasions, the need to meet with [Sunflower\u2019s] public adjuster to try and\nreach a resolution; that the two parties had essentially agreed to the scope of the\ndamage, and that it was just a matter of amount of damage; that the parties should\nmeet and reach an agreement as to the amount.\u201d Id. at 4930\u201331. Sunflower also\nstated that it would have \u201ccross examine[d] [Stevens] on the fact that the information,\nwhich [was] in the reports that he prepared, sa[id] nothing about inflated estimate,\nfraud, or raise[d] any red flags whatsoever, which goes to his credibility as an expert\nnow testifying that clearly looking at an estimate that he had dating back to May of\n2016 it shows evidence of clear massive fraud.\u201d Id. at 4931.\nSunflower argues in its appeal that \u201c[a]llowing the jury to hear the total\namount of Stevens\u2019 estimate upon which the Undisputed Payment was based, without\n27admitting Stevens\u2019 own detailed reports, prohibited the jury from fully comparing\nand understanding the reasons behind the difference in the total values of these\nestimates.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 52 (emphasis in original). Sunflower also argues that the\n\u201c[a]dmission of those documents would have helped the jury understand how\nOwners\u2019 stories about fraudulent inflation and late notice causing prejudice were not\nbased [on] actual concerns of Owners\u2019 [sic] during the claims process, and were\nfabricated only after suit was filed.\u201d Id.\nWe conclude, contrary to Sunflower\u2019s assertions, that the district court did not\nabuse its discretion in excluding the exhibits. To begin with, the district court\nexpressly ruled that Sunflower was free to cross-examine Stevens regarding the\nexhibits, even though the exhibits would not be admitted. Nevertheless, Sunflower\nchose not to do so, and it offers no explanation in its opening appellate brief for this\nfailure. Thus, as Owners correctly observes in its appellate response brief,\n\u201cSunflower\u2019s failure to use the exhibits\u201d to impeach Stevens \u201cis not the district\ncourt\u2019s error,\u201d but rather \u201cSunflower\u2019s\u201d error. Aple. Br. at 42. In any event,\nSunflower did cross-examine Page regarding the excluded exhibits and elicited from\nhim that Stevens\u2019 initial estimate erroneously omitted eleven different items of\ndamages.\n5) Did the district court err in granting partial summary judgment in favor\nof Owners on Sunflower\u2019s claims for breach of contract and bad faith?\nIn its fifth and final issue on appeal, Sunflower argues that the district court\nerred in granting partial summary judgment in favor of Owners on Sunflower\u2019s\n28claims for breach of contract and bad faith. We review de novo the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s\nsummary-judgment ruling, applying the same standard that applied in district court.\u201d\nGreer v. City of Wichita, 943 F.3d 1320, 1322 (10th Cir. 2019). We also \u201chave\ndiscretion to affirm\u201d the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling \u201con any ground\nadequately supported by the record, so long as the parties have had a fair opportunity\nto address that ground.\u201d Hasan v. AIG Prop. Cas. Co., 935 F.3d 1092, 1099 (10th\nCir. 2019) (quotations and brackets omitted).\nOwners argues in response that the jury\u2019s verdict supplies an independent basis\nfor affirming the district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling on Sunflower\u2019s breach of\ncontract and bad faith claims. Aple. Br. at 45\u201346. We agree. Because the jury found\nthat Sunflower violated the Policy\u2019s Fraud Clauses, that determination effectively\nvoids the Policy. As a result, Owners could not, consistent with that verdict, be\nfound to have either breached the Policy or engaged in bad faith by failing to pay the\nfull amount of damages claimed by Sunflower, since Sunflower\u2019s violation and the\nresulting voidance of the contract preceded any alleged breach by Owners. See\ngenerally Wilson v. Muckala, 303 F.3d 1207, 1219 (10th Cir. 2002) (concluding\n\u201cthat, even if it was error to grant summary judgment for the board members, any\nerror was harmless\u201d because \u201c[p]laintiffs could not have sustained a cause of action\nin negligence against these individuals when the alleged perpetrator himself was\nexonerated of negligence\u201d); Fraser v. Major League Soccer, LLC, 284 F.3d 47, 60-61\n(1st Cir. 2002) (concluding that the grant of summary judgment on a particular claim\nwas harmless in light of the jury\u2019s subsequent verdict).\n29III\nThe judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

FLETCHER and FRIEDLAND, Circuit Judges, and HILLMAN,**\nDistrict Judge.\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The Honorable Timothy Hillman, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.Plaintiffs Curtis Johnson and Gary Johnson appeal the district court\u2019s denial\nof their motion for class certification against SCI California Funeral Services, Inc.\n(\u201cSCI Cal\u201d). We review the denial of a class certification order for an abuse of\ndiscretion, see Senne v. Kansas City Royals Baseball Corp., 934 F.3d 918, 926 (9th\nCir. 2019), and affirm the district court.1\nSCI Cal provides support services for preparing and transporting bodies for\nfuneral homes. In the relevant class period, SCI Cal contracted with Serenity for\nmortuary drivers who could pick up and transport deceased persons. Serenity had\ndrivers on twenty-four hour standby. When a client such as SCI Cal needed a\ndriver to transport a decedent, it would call Serenity, which in turn would dispatch\none of its on-call drivers to perform the transport. In 2016, SCI Cal was one of\nabout eighty regular clients contracting with Serenity, and its business comprised\nless than fifteen percent of Serenity\u2019s gross revenue.\nPlaintiffs are former drivers for Serenity who allege various federal and state\nlabor violations against Serenity and SCI Cal. Plaintiffs allege liability against SCI\n1 SCI Cal\u2019s motion for certification to the state supreme court [D.E. 8] is\nDENIED. Amici Curiae The California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation,\nAAAJ\u2014Asian Law Caucus, Legal Aid at Work, and California Employment\nLawyers Association\u2019s motion for leave to file an amicus brief [D.E. 24] is\nGRANTED. Amicus Curiae Cemetery and Mortuary Association of California\u2019s\nmotion to take judicial notice [D.E. 47] is GRANTED.\n2Cal under section 2810.3 of the California Labor Code, which provides that \u201c[a]\nclient employer shall share with a labor contractor all civil legal responsibility and\ncivil liability for all workers supplied by that labor contractor for . . . [t]he payment\nof wages.\u201d Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2810.3(b). A client employer is defined as \u201ca\nbusiness entity . . . that obtains or is provided workers to perform labor within its\nusual course of business from a labor contractor.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2810.3(a)(1)(A). A labor\ncontractor is defined as \u201can individual or entity that supplies . . . a client employer\nwith workers to perform labor within the client employer\u2019s usual course of\nbusiness.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2810.3(a)(3). The \u201cusual course of business\u201d is defined as \u201cthe\nregular and customary work of a business, performed within or upon the premises\nor worksite of the client employer.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2810.3(a)(6). Plaintiffs allege that under\n\u00a7 2810.3, SCI Cal is a client employer liable for the labor violations of Serenity, a\nlabor contractor.\nThe district court granted in part and denied in part class certification. See\nJohnson v. Serenity Transp., No. 15-cv-02004, 2018 WL 3646540, at *19 (N.D.\nCal. Aug. 1, 2018). As relevant here, the district court denied certification of the\nproposed sub-class against SCI Cal, which is defined as \u201call persons from the class\nwho were made available to SCI/SCI Cal between January 1, 2015 through class\ncertification.\u201d Id. at *6. SCI Cal had argued that the sub-class included drivers\n3who were on-call to be dispatched to SCI Cal, even if they never actually made a\ndelivery for SCI Cal. Id. at *17.\nThe district court held that Plaintiffs could not make a claim against SCI Cal\nunder \u00a7 2810.3 for on-call liability based on Serenity\u2019s labor violations. The court\nreasoned that \u00a7 2810.3\u2019s definitions of \u201cclient employer,\u201d \u201clabor contractor,\u201d and\n\u201cusual course of business\u201d all \u201creference work that is performed.\u201d Id. at *17\n(emphasis in original). In particular, the \u201cusual course of business\u201d for which the\nclient employer obtains or is provided labor is work \u201cperformed within or upon the\npremises or the worksite of the client employer.\u201d Id. (quoting Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7\n2810.3(a)(6)). This qualifier excluded liability for on-call time against SCI Cal\nbecause the time a driver spent awaiting a dispatch call to \u201cany Serenity client\u201d\nwas not work \u201c\u2018performed on the premises or worksite\u2019 of SCI.\u201d Id. at *19, *17\n(emphasis in original). Accordingly, common questions did not predominate in a\nsub-class defined as all drivers \u201cmade available\u201d to SCI Cal. Id. at *19; see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 23(b)(3). Although an individual driver who performed labor for SCI Cal,\nand was not merely \u201cmade available\u201d by being on call for Serenity, could\npotentially show liability under \u00a7 2810.3, such an inquiry would be highly\nindividualized.\n4We hold that given the language of \u00a7 2810.3 and its legislative history, see\nSerenity, 2018 WL 3646540, at *18, the district court did not abuse its discretion.\nSee Senne, 934 F.3d at 926. In the relevant period, Serenity had about eighty\nregular clients, and SCI Cal comprised less than fifteen percent of Serenity\u2019s\nbusiness during at least part of this time. Although SCI Cal may be liable for the\ntime during which Plaintiffs \u201cperformed\u201d labor for it, the district court did not err\nin its bottom-line conclusion that \u00a7 2810.3 does not impose liability for the time\nduring which members of the putative class, many of whom may have never\nactually completed a dispatch for SCI Cal during any given shift, awaited a\ndispatch to any one of Serenity\u2019s many clients. The court\u2019s determination of the\nscope of liability under \u00a7 2810.3 was not a premature merits ruling, but the type of\n\u201crigorous analysis\u201d of Rule 23 requirements that, in appropriate cases, district\ncourts properly conduct in a class certification decision. Wal-Mart, Inc. v. Dukes,\n564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); see also Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 657 F.3d\n970, 981 (9th Cir. 2011).\nPlaintiffs also argue that the district court erred by indicating that it would\ndeny class certification against Serenity for overtime, minimum wage, and meal\nand rest break claims in the event that the court found that Serenity is not liable for\nsuch claims during on-call time. We hold that this issue is not presented at this\n5time. Only if and when the court (1) determines that Serenity is not liable for such\nclaims and (2) enters an order denying class certification, will the issue be\npresented. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).\nAFFIRMED.\n6",

MOLLOY,\nDefendant-Respondent.\n_________________________\nArgued telephonically January 23, 2020 -\nDecided February 7, 2020\nBefore Judges Koblitz, Whipple, and Mawla.\nOn appeal from the Superior Court of New Jersey,\nChancery Division, Family Part, Bergen County,\nDocket No. FM-02-1679-13.\nPaul J. Concannon and Shelley D. Albert argued the\ncause for appellant (Dario, Albert, Metz, Eyerman,\nCanda, Concannon, Ortiz & Krouse, attorneys; Paul J.\nConcannon and Shelley D. Albert, on the briefs).\nMatheu D. Nunn argued the cause for respondent\n(Einhorn, Barbarito, Frost & Botwinick, attorneys;\nMatheu D. Nunn and Jessie M. Mills, on the brief).PER CURIAM\nPlaintiff James L. Molloy appeals from a January 9, 2019 post-judgment\norder requiring him to pay defendant Joan C. Molloy additional alimony based\non his total income, which included income from restricted stock units (RSUs)\nthat were equitably distributed pursuant to the terms of their marital settlement\nagreement (MSA). For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for a\nplenary hearing.\nThe parties divorced in March 2014, following a twenty-six-year\nmarriage. Paragraph fourteen of their MSA required plaintiff to pay a base\nalimony of $66,667 per year, and an additional lump sum alimony of\n33.3% of the gross pretax amount of \"compensation for\nlump sum alimony purposes[,]\" . . . defined as any\nsalary above $220,000 gross per year and any incentive\naward, stock, restricted stock award, stock option\naward, bonus, commission, or other compensation that\nwould be characterized as W-2 or 1099 income paid to\n[plaintiff] by his employer(s).\nIn relevant part, paragraph forty-one of the MSA provided defendant 200\nof an 1122 award of RSUs from plaintiff's employer. Plaintiff retained the\nremaining 922 RSUs, and the MSA required he hold defendant's RSUs in a\nCallahan1 trust for her benefit. A separate paragraph of the MSA stated:\n1 Callahan v. Callahan, 142 N.J. Super. 325 (App. Div. 1976).\n2 A-2370-18T3Except as provided in this [a]greement, each party may\ndispose of his or her property in any way. Each party\nwaives and relinquishes any and all rights he or she may\nnow have or hereafter acquire under the present or\nfuture law of any jurisdiction to share in the property or\nthe estate of the other as a result of the marital\nrelationship.\nIn 2018, the parties disputed whether the additional lump-sum alimony\nplaintiff calculated and paid to defendant was accurate for 2015 through 2017.\nThe parties engaged counsel to resolve the dispute but were unsuccessful.\nPlaintiff insisted defendant owed him a credit and refused to pay the additional\nalimony until she paid the sum. Defendant filed a motion to enforce litigant's\nrights to recover the lump sum alimony she purported was owed. We focus on\nthe parties' dispute regarding the 2015 alimony calculation, which is related to\nthis appeal.\nIn her motion, defendant included the 1122 RSUs in her calculation of\nplaintiff's gross 2015 earnings and calculated his income to be $429,609.69.\nPursuant to the MSA, to determine plaintiff's 2015 additional lump sum alimony\nobligation, defendant subtracted $220,000 and the value of the 200 RSUs\nattributable to her. She divided the net figure by 33.3%, yielding $59,728.77 as\nthe additional lump sum alimony. She subtracted $13,367.65, which plaintiff\npreviously paid for 2015, leaving $46,361.12 outstanding.\n3 A-2370-18T3Plaintiff's calculations differed. Utilizing the same total earnings of\n$429,609.69, he subtracted the total value of the 1122 RSUs, other expenses,\nand the $220,000 yielding $19,224. Dividing this sum by one-third, plaintiff\nnetted $6408 as the additional lump sum amount. He reasoned because he had\npaid defendant $13,367, she owed him $69592, representing an overpayment.\nThe motion judge heard oral argument and concluded the following:\nThe parties were . . . represented by counsel as\nthey negotiated this agreement . . . and had . . . an\nopportunity to thoroughly [vet] each and every\nparagraph within the [MSA] before signing [it].\nAs such, the [c]ourt finds that this agreement\nwould not appear . . . to be based on any form of\ncoercion, duress, or fraud.\nSo[,] in light of the absence of any finding of\ncoercion, duress, or fraud the MSA stands as it is\nwritten.\nNow, [three] and a half years later plaintiff has\nbuyer's remorse and wants to upend the agreement. . . .\nClearly and carefully [the MSA] sets forth a base\nalimony under Paragraph [fourteen.]\nAnd the crux of this argument is . . . the initial\nlump sum alimony and the amounts and the calculation\nfor the additional lump sum alimony, and what the\nadditional lump sum alimony entails.\n2 Plaintiff's final sum was $6960, which we assume was a product of rounding.\n4 A-2370-18T3Paragraph [fourteen] clearly articulates the term\n\"Compensation for lump sum alimony purposes shall be\ndefined as any salary above $220,000 gross per year,\nany incentive award, stock, restricted stock award,\nstock option award, bonus commission, or other\ncompensation that would be characterized as a W-2 or\n1099 income paid to husband by his employer.\"\nTherefore, any item that's listed on his W-2, with\nthe exception, I think, of the changed tax law regarding\nthe health insurance, would be characterized as the\nincome.\nNow, plaintiff speaks to whether or not the\n[RSUs] issued in . . . 2012 based on past and future\nretention was addressed in Paragraph . . . [forty-one],\nwhich does not state that it needs to be read in\nconjunction with, or separate and apart from Paragraph\n[fourteen].\nAnd the . . . [1122] RSU[]s issued to plaintiff on\nor about November 22, 2012[,] were issued well in\nadvance of the date on which the parties executed the\n[MSA] and the final judgment of divorce was entered.\nAs such, the distribution of the . . . [RSUs] was\ncontemplated at the time the parties executed the\nMSA. . . . [P]laintiff [cannot] at this point have\nbuyer[']s remorse. He has lived with this agreement\nsince March of 2014.\nAs a result, I'm going to enforce all provisions of\nthe [MSA] as a valid and enforceable agreement.\nThe motion judge also rejected plaintiff's argument that relief from the\nMSA was warranted under Rule 4:50-1. Pursuant to Rule 4:50-2, she found the\n5 A-2370-18T3grounds for relief under Rule 4:50-1(a)-(c) were time-barred and the relief\nsought under (d)-(f) was also barred because plaintiff's motion was not brought\nwithin a reasonable time.\nI.\nAlthough we typically defer to a trial court's factual determinations,\n\"[d]iscretionary determinations, supported by the record, are examined to\ndiscern whether an abuse of reasoned discretion has occurred.\" Ricci v. Ricci,\n448 N.J. Super 546, 564 (App. Div. 2017). A trial court's interpretation of the\nlaw is reviewed de novo on appeal. S.D. v. M.J.R., 415 N.J. Super. 417, 430\n(App. Div. 2010) (citing Manalapan Realty, LP v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan,\n140 N.J. 366, 378 (1995)). A motion for relief under Rule 4:50-1 should be\ngranted sparingly and is similarly addressed to the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt, whose determination will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of\ndiscretion. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Guillaume, 209 N.J. 449, 467 (2012).\nPlaintiff argues the motion judge's award of additional lump sum alimony\nbased on a calculation of his income using the 922 RSUs he retained under the\nMSA \"constituted an impermissible double-dipping.\" He asserts defendant's\nfailure to include the income from the sale of the 200 RSUs she received in\n6 A-2370-18T3equitable distribution proves she understood the 1122 tranche of RSUs was\nexcluded from income for purposes of calculating additional lump sum alimony.\nPlaintiff argues the MSA contained an express mutual waiver of all rights\neach party had in the other's property, including the RSUs distributed pursuant\nto the MSA. He asserts the MSA should be reformed to cure \"a drafting error\nby [d]efendant's counsel, to avoid an unconscionable result\" because defendant's\nreceipt of \"[seventy-three percent] of the net value of the RSUs\" was\n\"unconscionable.\" Plaintiff contends he did not intend such a result and the\nmotion judge erred in resolving the material factual dispute without a plenary\nhearing.\nA.\nA marital settlement agreement is a contract that is enforceable to the extent\nit is fair and equitable. Peterson v. Peterson, 85 N.J. 638, 642 (1981) (citations\nomitted). \"The very consensual and voluntary character of these agreements render\nthem optimum solutions for abating marital discord, resolving matrimonial\ndifferences, reaching accommodations between divorced couples, and assuring\nstability in post-divorce relationships.\" Konzelman v. Konzelman, 158 N.J. 185,\n194 (1999). \"Marital agreements . . . are approached with a predisposition in favor\nof their validity and enforceability.\" Massar v. Massar, 279 N.J. Super. 89, 93 (App.\n7 A-2370-18T3Div. 1995) (citation omitted). Such arrangements \"'should not be unnecessarily or\nlightly disturbed.'\" Konzelman, 158 N.J. at 193-94 (quoting Smith v. Smith, 72 N.J.\n350, 358 (1981)).\nAt the outset, we reject plaintiff's argument the lump sum alimony\ncalculation required the motion judge to include defendant's share of the RSUs.\nThe MSA clearly states \"[i]ncreases in [defendant's] earned income shall reduce\n[plaintiff's] alimony obligation.\" The liquidation of defendant's share of the\nRSUs constituted a realization of unearned income and did not affect alimony.\nWe also reject plaintiff's argument the MSA created an \"impermissible\ndouble-dipping\" pursuant to Innes v. Innes, 117 N.J. 496 (1990) and N.J.S.A.\n2A:34-23(b). Innes and the statute stand for the proposition that retirement\nbenefits treated as assets for purposes of equitable distribution shall not be\nconsidered income for purposes of determining alimony. 117 N.J. at 504-05.\nThe RSUs were not a retirement benefit but earned income.\nIn Steneken v. Steneken, 183 N.J. 290 (2005), our Supreme Court upheld\nthe use of a normalized income calculation for purposes of determining\nequitable distribution of a business operated by the supporting spouse and an\nentirely different income amount based on the spouse's actual earnings for\npurposes of calculating alimony. The Court stated:\n8 A-2370-18T3Although some jurisdictions do prohibit the\ndisparate alimony and equitable distribution\ncalculations defendant finds objectionable, others allow\nit. . . . Because we embrace the premise that alimony\nand equitable distribution calculations, albeit\ninterrelated, are separate, distinct, and not entirely\ncompatible financial exercises, and because asset\nvaluation methodologies applied in the equitable\ndistribution setting are not congruent with the factors\nrelevant to alimony considerations, we conclude that\nthe circumstances here present a fair and proper method\nof both awarding alimony and determining equitable\ndistribution.\nWe find no inequity in the use of the individually\nfair results obtained due to the use of an asset valuation\nmethodology normalizing salary in an on-going close\ncorporation for equitable distribution purposes, and the\nuse of actual salary received in the calculus of alimony.\nThe interplay of those two calculations does not\nconstitute \"double counting.\"\n[Id. at 301-02.]\nThe same principles apply here. Plaintiff's share of the 1122 tranche of\nRSUs was not liquidated and paid to defendant as alimony. He retained his\nequitable distribution. However, under one reading of the MSA those shares\nwere reported as plaintiff's income for 2015, and were therefore includable for\npurposes of calculating his overall income and the additional lump sum alimony\naward.\n9 A-2370-18T3B.\nWe are constrained to remand the matter for a plenary hearing because the\nparties' common intent respecting the treatment of the 1122 RSU tranche is not\nreadily discernable. Our Supreme Court has stated:\nAs a general rule, courts should enforce contracts\nas the parties intended. . . . Similarly, it is a basic rule\nof contractual interpretation that a court must discern\nand implement the common intention of the parties.\nTessmar v. Grosner, 23 N.J. 193, 201 (1957). The\ncourt's role is to consider what is written in the context\nof the circumstances at the time of drafting and to apply\na rational meaning in keeping with the \"expressed\ngeneral purpose.\"\n[Pacifico v. Pacifico, 190 N.J. 258, 266 (2007)\n(citations omitted).]\nAlthough \"not every factual dispute that arises in the context of\nmatrimonial proceedings triggers the need for a plenary hearing[,] . . . we have\nrepeatedly emphasized that trial judges cannot resolve material factual disputes\nupon conflicting affidavits and certifications.\" Harrington v. Harrington, 281\nN.J. Super. 39, 47 (App. Div. 1995). Plenary hearings are necessary where they\nare helpful to resolve material factual disputes. Jacoby v. Jacoby, 427 N.J.\nSuper. 109, 123 (App. Div. 2012). This case presents such a situation.\nIndeed, it is possible to read the additional lump sum alimony language\nconsistent with defendant's argument the parties intended to include plaintiff's\n10 A-2370-18T3share of the 1122 tranche in the calculation of the additional lump sum alimony.\nHowever, when the provision is read in conjunction with the parties' mutual\nexpress waiver of any interest in the other's equitable distribution, plaintiff's\nargument the 1122 tranche was not a part of the lump sum alimony calculation\nis equally plausible. Moreover, the \"[e]xcept as provided in this [a]greement\"\nlanguage contained in the waiver paragraph did not resolve whether plaintiff's\nshare of the RSUs were excluded from the alimony calculation because the\nparties had opposite explanations regarding the reason for the disproportionate\ndistribution of the RSUs in question. The motion judge's findings did not\nresolve these issues.

Lerbakken\nlllllllllllllllllllllDebtor\n------------------------------\nBrian A. Lerbakken\nlllllllllllllllllllllAppellant\nv.\nSieloff and Associates, P.A.\nlllllllllllllllllllllAppellee\n------------------------------\nNational Consumer Bankruptcy Rights Center; National Association of Consumer\nBankruptcy Attorneys\nlllllllllllllllllllllAmici on Behalf of Appellant(s)\n____________\nAppeal from the United States Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit\n____________Submitted: November 14, 2019\nFiled: February 7, 2020\n____________\nBefore COLLOTON, WOLLMAN, and BENTON, Circuit Judges.\n____________\nBENTON, Circuit Judge.\nA state court awarded Brian A. Lerbakken part of his ex-wife\u2019s Individual\nRetirement Account and her 401(k) in a dissolution decree. Lerbakken filed for\nbankruptcy, claiming that his interests in the IRA and 401(k) are exempt as\n\u201cretirement funds.\u201d Sieloff & Associates, P.A., a creditor, objected to the exemptions.\nThe bankruptcy court disallowed them, ruling that Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA\nand 401(k) are not retirement funds. In re Lerbakken, Order, BKY 18-50037 (Bankr.\nD. Minn. May 15, 2018). Lerbakken appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel,\nwhich affirmed. Lerbakken v. Sieloff & Assoc., P.A. (In re Lerbakken), 590 B.R.\n895, 897-98 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2018). Lerbakken appeals the BAP\u2019s judgment. Having\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d)(1), this court affirms.\nI.\nSieloff represented Lerbakken in his dissolution in Minnesota. The court\u2019s\ndecree awarded Lerbakken all of his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and half of her 401(k). The court\nordered Lerbakken to submit a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).\nLerbakken refused, which leaves him with only a domestic relations order.\nTwo months after the decree, the court ordered an attorney\u2019s lien against\nLerbakken for Sieloff\u2019s legal services. The court expressly permitted Sieloff to\nrecover the unpaid fees from Lerbakken\u2019s interests in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and 401(k).\nThe unpaid fees exceed the total of Lerbakken\u2019s interests.\n-2-Six months after the decree, Lerbakken filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7,\nclaiming that his interests in the IRA and 401(k) are exempt from the bankruptcy\nestate as \u201cretirement funds\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C). Sieloff, a scheduled\ncreditor, objected to the exemptions.\nThe bankruptcy court1 disallowed the exemptions. It ruled that Lerbakken\u2019s\ninterests in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and 401(k) are not \u201cretirement funds.\u201d The Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel (BAP) affirmed.2 It ruled, relying on Clark v. Rameker, 573 U.S. 122,\n130 (2014), that section 522(b)(3)(C) applied only to the person who created and\ncontributed to the retirement account.\nOn appeal, this court again reviews the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision,\nindependently applying the same standard as the BAP. See Treadwell v. Glenstone\nLodge, Inc. (In re Treadwell), 637 F.3d 855, 863 (8th Cir. 2011). This court reviews\nthe bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error, and its conclusions of law de\nnovo. Id.\nII.\nWhen a debtor files for bankruptcy, all of his or her property becomes property\nof a bankruptcy estate. Taylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 642 (1992). See\nalso 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541 (describing the formation of a bankruptcy estate). A debtor may\nprevent the distribution of property claimed as exempt. Taylor, 503 U.S. at 642. One\nexemption is \u201cretirement funds to the extent those funds are in a fund or account that\nis exempt from taxation under section 401, 403, 408, 408A, 414, 457, or 501(a) of the\n1The Honorable Robert J. Kressel, Judge, United States Bankruptcy Court for\nthe District of Minnesota.\n2The Honorable Anita L. Shodeen, Bankruptcy Judge, United States Bankruptcy\nAppellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit, writing for a unanimous panel.\n-3-Internal Revenue Code.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C). This exemption \u201crequires that\nfunds satisfy not one but two provisions to be exempt: the funds must be \u2018retirement\nfunds,\u2019 and they must be held in a covered account.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 131.\nThe first issue is whether Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) are\n\u201cretirement funds\u201d and thus eligible for exemption under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C)\nwhen the accounts were created and maintained by his ex-wife and Lerbakken\u2019s\ninterests resulted from a divorce decree.\nIn Clark, the Court defined \u201cretirement funds\u201d as \u201csums of money set aside for\nthe day an individual stops working.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 127. The Court focused on\nthree significant legal characteristics of ordinary retirement funds. Id. at 125.\nAccount holders of ordinary retirement funds (1) are able to make additional\ncontributions to the funds, (2) are not obligated to withdraw the funds, and (3) must\npay a penalty to withdraw the funds at any time, for any purpose, prior to the age of\n59 \u00bd. Id. at 128. Ultimately, \u201cretirement funds\u201d are \u201cfunds objectively set aside for\none\u2019s retirement,\u201d not \u201ca pot of money that can be freely used for current\nconsumption.\u201d Id. at 128-29.\nIII.\nAs for the IRA, Lerbakken\u2019s most cogent argument is that the Internal Revenue\nCode says that an IRA transferred incident to divorce is \u201ctreated as an individual\nretirement account of such [recipient] spouse, and not of such [donor] individual.\u201d\n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(d)(6). Lerbakken then reasons that an IRA transferred incident to\ndivorce necessarily satisfies the legal characteristics of an ordinary IRA. See Clark,\n573 U.S. at 127.\nUnfortunately for Lerbakken, these tax provisions do not make his IRA interest\n\u201cretirement funds\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code. The date of filing, January 23, 2018,\n-4-determines the property of the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 522(b)(3)(A), 541.\n\u201cA debtor\u2019s exemptions are determined as of the time of the filing of his [bankruptcy]\npetition.\u201d In re Peterson, 897 F.2d 935, 937 (8th Cir. 1990). Exemptions are \u201cnot of\nproperty which would or might be exempt if some condition not performed were\nperformed, but of property to which there is... a present right of exemption\u201d on the\ndate when the petition is filed. Myers v. Manley, 318 U.S. 622, 626 (1943).\nWhen Lerbakken filed for bankruptcy on January 23, 2018, his interest in his\nex-wife\u2019s IRA was subject to a condition not performed\u2014it had not been renamed, or\ntransferred into an account under his name. See I.R.S. Pub. No. 590-A, Cat. No.\n66302J at 28 (Dec. 21, 2018) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590a.pdf) (describing\nthe \u201ctwo commonly used methods of transferring IRA assets to a ... former spouse\u201d).\nThe issue then is whether Lerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA\nhas the legal characteristics of ordinary retirement funds. As for the first\ncharacteristic, Lerbakken could make additional contributions, on January 23, 2018,\nto his ex-wife\u2019s IRA. See I.R.S. Pub. No. 504, Cat. No. 15006I at 18-19 (Feb. 5,\n2019) (https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p504.pdf).\nSecond, state law obligates Lerbakken to withdraw his conditional interest in\nthe IRA. Lerbakken\u2019s interest is defined by state law. See Butner v. United States,\n440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979) (holding that, absent a contrary federal interest, \u201c[p]roperty\ninterests are created and defined by state law\u201d). The governing state law\u2014the\ndissolution decree and the court-ordered attorney\u2019s lien\u2014define Lerbakken\u2019s interest\nas a debt owed to Sieloff. By the decree and lien, Lerbakken is supposed to effectuate\na transfer or renaming of his ex-wife\u2019s IRA to pay a debt \u201cregardless of [his]\nproximity to retirement.\u201d See Clark, 573 U.S. at 128. The purpose of the second\ncharacteristic is to preserve the account for retirement. Id. Because the dissolution\nof Lerbakken\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s IRA is obligatory, his interest does not satisfy the second\ncharacteristic.\n-5-Third, no transfer of the IRA had occurred by January 23, 2018, so Lerbakken\nwas free from the rules that encourage leaving the funds untouched until retirement\nage. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(d)(6), 72(t)(1), (2)(C), (3)(A). See also Clark, 573 U.S.\nat 128-29. Lerbakken\u2019s IRA interest was not subject to the rules for ordinary IRAs\ntransferred incident to divorce because it had not been transferred. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\n408(d)(6). Lerbakken\u2019s IRA interest is not \u201ctreated as an individual retirement\naccount\u201d belonging to him. See id. Rather, Lerbakken\u2019s interest in the IRA was a\nsum of money in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA, not an account \u201cset aside for the day when an\nindividual stops working.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 127.\nLerbakken\u2019s interest in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA lacks most of the legal characteristics\nof ordinary \u201cretirement funds,\u201d and is not exempted as \u201cretirement funds\u201d under\nsection 522(b)(3)(C).3\nIV.\nAs for the 401(k),4 Lerbakken did not have a QDRO on January 23, 2018. He\ncannot access his interest in the account without a QDRO. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1056(d)(1), (3)(A). See also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 72(t)(2)(C), 414(p)(1)(A), 401(a)(13)(A)-\n(B). \u201cThe QDRO provisions of ERISA do not suggest that an alternate payee [what\nLerbakken would be] has no interest in the plans until [he] obtains a QDRO, they\nmerely prevent [him] from enforcing [his] interest until the QDRO is obtained.\u201d See\n3Because Lerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in the IRA is not \u201cretirement funds,\u201d\nthis court need not address the \u201ccovered account\u201d requirement. See Clark, 573 U.S.\nat 131. See also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C).\n4Although Lerbakken\u2019s interest in the 401(k) may be an ERISA-qualified plan\nand thus excluded from his bankruptcy estate by the anti-alienation language of 29\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1), Lerbakken has waived this issue, as he expressly says. See\nPatterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S. 753, 760 (1992) (holding that ERISA\u2019s anti-\nalienation provision \u201cconstitutes an enforceable transfer restriction for purposes of 11\nU.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2)\u2019s exclusion of property from the bankruptcy estate\u201d).\n-6-Nelson v. Ramette, 322 F.3d 541, 544 (8th Cir. 2003). In the absence of a QDRO,\nstate law determines Lerbakken\u2019s property interest in the 401(k) on January 23, 2018.\nSee Butner, 440 U.S. at 55. The governing state law\u2014the dissolution decree and the\ncourt-ordered attorney\u2019s lien\u2014define Lerbakken\u2019s interest in his ex-wife\u2019s 401(k) as\na debt owed to Sieloff.\nBy Clark\u2019s framework, Lerbakken\u2019s 401(k) interest is not a \u201cretirement fund.\u201d\nAs for the first legal characteristic of ordinary retirement funds, Lerbakken could not\nmake additional contributions to his ex-wife\u2019s 401(k) on January 23, 2018, because\ncontributions must be made by the employer or employee, not an ex-spouse. See 26\nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401(a)(1), (13)(A)-(B). Second, Lerbakken is obligated by state law to\nwithdraw the funds to pay Sieloff for legal services, not to use the funds for\nretirement. Third, without a QDRO, Lerbakken could not make a withdrawal on\nJanuary 23, 2018. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1056(d)(1), (3)(A). See also 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n72(t)(2)(C), 414(p)(1)(A). See also Nelson, 322 F.3d at 544.\nLerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in the 401(k) lacks the legal characteristics of\nordinary \u201cretirement funds,\u201d and is not exempted as \u201cretirement funds\u201d under section\n522(b)(3)(C).5\nV.\nLerbakken advances four broad arguments. First, he says that the BAP and\nthe bankruptcy court misapplied Clark by limiting the \u201cretirement funds\u201d exemption\n\u201cto individuals who create and contribute funds into the retirement account.\u201d In re\nLerbakken, 590 B.R. at 897 (discussing the ordinary usage of retirement funds as\nexcluding funds set aside for retirement by a different person). As Clark says, the key\n5Because Lerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in the 401(k) is not \u201cretirement\nfunds,\u201d this court need not address the \u201ccovered account\u201d requirement. See Clark,\n573 U.S. at 131. See also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C).\n-7-features of \u201cretirement funds\u201d are the objective legal characteristics. Clark, 573 U.S.\nat 125, 128-29. As discussed, Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) do not\nhave the necessary legal characteristics.\nSecond, Lerbakken argues that the similar tax treatment of transferred and\nsurviving-spouse IRAs necessitates treating accounts transferred incident to divorce\nthe same as accounts inherited by surviving spouses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(d)(3)(C)(ii),\n(d)(6). However, the Court suggests that even a surviving spouse\u2014which Lerbakken\nis not\u2014does not have \u201cretirement funds\u201d when the surviving spouse does not roll over\nthe IRA into his own IRA. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 125. Lerbakken failed to roll over\nthe funds from his ex-wife\u2019s accounts into his own accounts by January 23, 2018,\nwhen exemptions are determined. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 522(b)(2)(A), 541.\nThird, Lerbakken asserts that the funds in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and 401(k) were\nintended to support both spouses in retirement. However, Clark explicitly prohibits\na \u201ccase-by-case, fact-intensive\u201d examination of subjective purpose\u2014which forbids\nexamining Lerbakken\u2019s (or his ex-wife\u2019s) intent. Clark, 573 U.S. at 127. See also id.\nat 133 (\u201cthe possibility\u201d that debtors may use funds for \u201cretirement purposes\u201d does not\nmean an IRA meets the \u201cdefining legal characteristics of retirement funds\u201d).\nFinally, Lerbakken advances other policy reasons for his exemptions. To the\ncontrary, the exemption provisions of the Bankruptcy Code \u201ceffectuate a careful\nbalance between the interests of creditors and debtors.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 129.\nIndeed, permitting debtors to enjoy cash windfalls through exemption \u201cwould convert\nthe Bankruptcy Code\u2019s purposes of preserving debtors\u2019 ability to meet their basic\nneeds and ensuring they have a \u2018fresh start\u2019 into a \u2018free pass.\u2019\u201d Id. at 130 (citations\nomitted). In Lerbakken\u2019s words, \u201cIt was [his] strategy to use the determination in the\nbankruptcy that the accounts were exempt to prevent [Sieloff] from enforcing its lien\nagainst the accounts after the bankruptcy case in state court.\u201d\n-8-Because Lerbakken\u2019s interests in his ex-wife\u2019s IRA and 401(k) are not\n\u201cretirement funds\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C), the bankruptcy court and the BAP\ncorrectly disallowed the exemptions from the bankruptcy estate.\n* * * * * * *\nThe judgment is affirmed.\n______________________________\n-9-",

Garst,\n) Judge Presiding.\nJUSTICE HOLDER WHITE delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices DeArmond and Turner concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: The appellate court affirmed, concluding defendant was not entitled to the return\nof his bail bond deposit.\n\u00b6 2 On July 26, 2017, defendant, Brandon Christie, filed a pro se \u201cMotion to Dismiss\nor Revoke Fines\u201d requesting that the trial court (1) vacate the fines and costs imposed as terms of\nhis sentence to probation and (2) refund his $400 bail bond that had been applied to those fines\nand costs. Defendant asserted that when his probation was revoked, the terms of his probation\nwere also revoked, including all financial obligations.\n\u00b6 3 The trial court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, at which only the State\nappeared. The court vacated the fines and costs that remained outstanding but declined to refunddefendant\u2019s $400 bail bond, reasoning that \u201cmoney that has been previously disbursed cannot be\nrefunded.\u201d\n\u00b6 4 On appeal, defendant argues the trial court erred in refusing to refund his $400\nbail bond. Alternatively, defendant contends his due process rights were violated because he was\nnot present at the hearing on his motion. We affirm.\n\u00b6 5 I.

In June\n2003, defendant pleaded guilty to count II and was sentenced to a two-year term of probation to\nbe served consecutively to a sentence of imprisonment he was serving in an unrelated case. The\nterms of defendant\u2019s probation required him to, inter alia, report to his probation officer within\none week of his release from prison and pay (1) court costs and (2) a $25 per month probation\nfee.\n\u00b6 7 In April 2005, the State filed a petition to revoke defendant\u2019s probation, alleging\nhe violated the terms of his probation by failing to report to his probation officer within seven\ndays of his release from imprisonment, and the trial court issued an arrest warrant. On January\n17, 2006, defendant was arrested and posted a $300 bail bond to secure his release from custody.\nDefendant admitted the allegations in the State\u2019s petition, and the trial court ordered a\npresentence investigation report (PSI) be prepared for resentencing. The PSI stated that the\n\u201ccircuit clerk\u2019s office shows an outstanding balance of $755.00.\u201d\n\u00b6 8 On August 21, 2006, the trial court resentenced defendant to a three-year term of\nprobation. The terms of defendant\u2019s probation required him to, in relevant part, pay (1) a $500\n- 2 -fine, (2) all previously-imposed, unpaid financial obligations, (3) court costs, and (4) a $25 per\nmonth probation fee, with his $300 bail bond to apply. The docket sheet shows defendant\u2019s bond\nwas \u201creclassed\u201d and an outstanding balance of $1255 remained following resentencing.\n\u00b6 9 In July 2007, the State filed another petition to revoke probation, alleging\ndefendant consumed illegal drugs in violation of the terms of his probation. Defendant denied the\nallegations and was ordered to appear at a pretrial hearing in September 2007. Defendant failed\nto appear at the hearing, resulting in the issuance of an arrest warrant. On September 17, 2007,\ndefendant was arrested and posted a $400 bail bond. In March 2008, the State filed an amended\npetition to revoke probation. Defendant admitted the allegations in the amended petition, and the\ntrial court ordered a PSI be prepared and continued the cause for resentencing. The PSI stated\nthat the \u201ccircuit clerk\u2019s office shows an outstanding balance of $900 in probation service fees\nand $355 in fines/costs.\u201d\n\u00b6 10 On June 27, 2008, the trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and resentenced\nhim to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The court did not order defendant to pay any fines or costs as\npart of his sentence.\n\u00b6 11 Defendant did not file a direct appeal. The record shows no further proceedings\nuntil a docket entry dated June 29, 2017. The docket entry reads as follows: \u201cReferral to\nCollection Agency Entered. (256.50 SA Collections added) New total due is 1,811.50. New\nbalance is 1,111.50.\u201d\n\u00b6 12 On July 26, 2017, defendant filed, pro se, the instant \u201cMotion to Dismiss or\nRevoke Fines.\u201d Defendant requested that the trial court (1) vacate the fines and costs imposed as\nterms of his sentence to probation and (2) refund his $400 bail bond. Defendant asserted that the\n- 3 -fines and costs were revoked when his probation was revoked and, as a result, the $400 bail bond\nthat was previously applied to them should be refunded.\n\u00b6 13 On July 28, 2017, the trial court briefly discussed the relevant portions of the\nrecord and the contents of defendant\u2019s motion with an assistant state\u2019s attorney (ASA) and then\ncontinued the matter \u201cso that the State can take a look at that.\u201d The court also stated that\ndefendant \u201cobviously does not need to be here [for the upcoming hearing].\u201d\n\u00b6 14 On August 25, 2017, the trial court conducted a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion.\nDefendant was not present, and an ASA appeared for the State. The following exchange occurred\nat the hearing:\n\u201cMR. GILBERT [(ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY)]: From what\nI\u2019ve seen, what I\u2019ve looked at, I believe [defendant] is correct in his Motion on\nthese fines. I believe the last time we were in court, the $400 that he was asking\nfor had already been disbursed.\nTHE COURT: Right. What I would show then on the docket is upon\n[ASA\u2019s] motion, the balance of anything owed is vacated. The matter is to be\nwithdrawn from collections. They\u2019re not to do anything else. Any requirement\nthat he appear is vacated. The file is closed.\nIndicate on the docket\u2014I guess also indicate on the docket though that\nmoney that has previously been disbursed cannot be refunded. And the Clerk is to\nsend a copy of the docket to [defendant].\u201d\n\u00b6 15 This appeal followed.\n\u00b6 16 II. ANALYSIS\n- 4 -\u00b6 17 Defendant argues the trial court erred in refusing to order the refund of his $400\nbail bond. Relying on section 110-7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Criminal Code)\n(725 ILCS 5/110-7 (West 2004)), defendant contends the circuit clerk had a statutory duty to\nreturn his bail bond. Alternatively, defendant argues his due process rights were violated because\nhe was not present at the hearing on his motion.\n\u00b6 18 Paragraph (f) of section 110-7 of the Criminal Code (725 ILCS 5/110-7(f) (West\n2004)) provides that the clerk of the court shall return a defendant\u2019s bail bond \u201c[w]hen the\nconditions of the bail bond have been performed and the [defendant] has been discharged from\nall obligations in the cause ***.\u201d Paragraph (h) of the same section provides that the bail bond\n\u201cshall be applied to the payment of [a judgment for a fine and court costs or either].\u201d 725 ILCS\n5/110-7(h) (West 2004).\n\u00b6 19 Here, the trial court did not err in refusing to order the refund of defendant\u2019s bail\nbond because even though the court vacated the balance owed, defendant had previously been\nobligated to pay (1) the probation fee for each month he was actually on probation and (2) court\ncosts. As part of defendant\u2019s sentence, he was required to pay a $25 per month probation fee.\nOnly a defendant \u201cwho is actively supervised by the probation and court services department\u201d is\nobligated to pay the fee. 730 ILCS 5/5-6-3(i) (West 2004). Although defendant\u2019s probation was\nrevoked before he served the entire three-year term, he was still required to pay the $25 fee for\neach month he was on probation. See id. The record shows defendant was on probation from\nJanuary 2006 until it was revoked in June 2008, for a total of 29 months. Thus, defendant was\nobligated to pay $725 in probation fees ($25 X 29 months), which was in addition to his\nobligation to pay court costs.\n- 5 -FILED\nFebruary 10,\n2020\nCarla\nBender\n\u00b6 20 Moreover, the dialogue between the trial court and counsel at the hearing strongly\nsuggests that by the time the court entered its order on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or revoke\nfines, the $400 bond posted years earlier had already been applied to defendant\u2019s prior balance.\nWe note, in resolving defendant\u2019s first probation violation the court imposed a $500 fine. Also,\nthe court\u2019s order on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or revoke fines vacated the balance owed at\nthe time the order was entered but did not vacate the imposition of any prior fines. Thus, the\ncourt\u2019s order in no way vacated the prior application of bond money to previously assessed fines,\nfees, and costs. Accordingly, we conclude defendant is not entitled to a refund of his bail bond\ndeposit. Based on this conclusion, we also find that, even assuming the trial court erred in\nconducting the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion without defendant being present, any error was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u00b6 21 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 22 For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\u00b6 23 Affirmed.\n- 6 -",

The BIA did not err by denying Petitioner\u2019s application for cancellation\nof removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1). Petitioner\u2019s daughter turned 21 before\nhis final removal hearing, so she was no longer a \"child\" under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1101(b)(1). Petitioner thus lacked any qualifying relative who would have made\nhim eligible for relief. See Mendez-Garcia v. Lynch, 840 F.3d 655, 664 (9th Cir.\n2016) (deferring under Chevron to In re Isidro-Zamorano, 25 I. & N. Dec. 829\n(B.I.A. 2012), and holding that the BIA \"reasonably determine[d] that\n\u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D) requires an alien seeking cancellation to establish hardship to a\nqualifying relative as of the time the IJ adjudicates the alien\u2019s application\").\nMendez-Garcia forecloses Petitioner\u2019s arguments that the BIA unreasonably\ninterpreted \u00a7 1229b(b)(1) and should have used the dictionary definition of \"child.\"\nSee id. at 665 (\"Because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(b)(1) [defines] the term 'child,' the\nstatutory definition controls.\").\n2. \"Even assuming that extraordinary delays caused by the agency could\ngive rise to a constitutional claim,\" id. at 667, this case does not involve such\ndelays. Petitioner was first served with a Notice to Appear in September 2011, and\nthe government scheduled a hearing before an IJ for one month thereafter.\n2Petitioner then successfully moved for two postponements of that hearing until\nOctober 2013. Although the government shutdown in October 2013 caused the IJ\nto reschedule Petitioner\u2019s hearing again, to January 2015, the shutdown itself lasted\nonly 16 days.1 Petitioner never objected to the delay, nor did he request an\nexpedited hearing date after the shutdown ended.\nAt the January 2015 hearing, the IJ warned Petitioner that his daughter\nwould cease to be a qualifying relative in January 2016, and the IJ double-booked\nhis calendar for a December 2015 hearing in an effort to accommodate Petitioner.\nThe IJ also suggested that Petitioner try to switch hearing dates with one of his\nattorney\u2019s other clients so that he could appear before October 1, 2015\u2014the date\nwhen the statutory limits on grants of cancellation of removal would reset for the\nnew fiscal year. But Petitioner failed to take any action until December 2015, one\nmonth before his daughter\u2019s 21st birthday, when he moved to switch hearing dates\nwith one of his attorney\u2019s other clients. Thus, even assuming that Petitioner has a\ndue process right to have his application for cancellation heard without\n\"extraordinary delay,\" the agency did not violate that right in this case. See id. at\n1 Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) allows us to take judicial notice of \"a fact\nthat is not subject to reasonable dispute because it . . . can be accurately and readily\ndetermined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" We\nmay do so even when reviewing an agency's decision.

Nader,\nRespondent-Appellee. ) Judge, Presiding.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nJUSTICE HUDSON delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Schostok and Bridges concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: The trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding petitioner temporary\nmaintenance and denying permanent maintenance; petitioner was awarded a greater\nshare of the marital assets, the marriage lasted only five years, neither party was\nfully healthy, and to the extent that respondent allegedly promised to \u201calways take\ncare of\u201d petitioner, he did not intend to do so after the marriage.\n\u00b6 2 When the marriage of petitioner, Valerie E. Dorgan, and respondent, Stephen E. Dorgan,\nwas dissolved, petitioner was awarded maintenance of $2099 for 11 months. Petitioner timely\nappeals that award, arguing that, because of her disability and grave illnesses, she should have\nbeen awarded permanent maintenance. We affirm.2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 The parties were married in November 2013. Four and one-half years later, in May 2018,\npetitioner petitioned to dissolve the marriage and for temporary or permanent maintenance. She\nclaimed that she was entitled to permanent maintenance given the parties disparate finances and\nher inability to work because she suffered from multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus, and lymphoma.\n\u00b6 5 Financial affidavits submitted to the court revealed that respondent received monthly\npension payments and social security benefits totaling $8130. After his monthly expenses were\ndeducted from this amount, he was left with a surplus of $2931. Petitioner\u2019s affidavit revealed\nthat every month she received $600 in rent and $1100 in monetary gifts. After her living expenses\nwere deducted, she was left with a deficit of $2068.\n\u00b6 6 Both parties had little debt and few assets. Respondent owned a vacation home in\nWisconsin that he purchased for $22,000. This home was purchased during the marriage. He also\nowned two boats. Petitioner bought one of the boats as a gift for respondent, spending between\n$4000 and $5000 for it. Petitioner owned the home in which she and respondent lived during the\nmarriage. The fair market value of that home was $245,620, with an outstanding mortgage of\n$135,000. Given the parties\u2019 circumstances, the court awarded petitioner temporary maintenance\nof $2099 per month. These payments began on January 1, 2019.\n\u00b6 7 At the hearing on the petition to dissolve the marriage, respondent, who was 63 years old\nand had difficulty hearing, testified that he is a retired disabled police officer. When the parties\nmet, petitioner, who had MS and used a wheelchair, was unemployed but in \u201cgreat health.\u201d Now,\nrespondent described her health as \u201c[p]retty poor,\u201d and he did not believe that she was able to\nwork. He \u201cbelieve[d]\u201d petitioner was \u201cdisabled.\u201d\n- 2 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\n\u00b6 8 After the parties married, petitioner contributed to the household expenses, using money\nshe received from her ex-husband\u2019s pensions. When petitioner\u2019s ex-husband passed away,\nrespondent assumed more of the responsibility for paying the parties\u2019 expenses. Although\nrespondent could not say from where petitioner was receiving money, he speculated that \u201cshe must\nhave a lot of money coming in.\u201d He explained that petitioner was able to pay her bills, her\nsubstantial property taxes, and her car payment.\n\u00b6 9 Petitioner, who was 58 years old, testified that she has an associate\u2019s degree and last\nworked over seven years ago. She was employed as a home healthcare representative, earning\n$3000 per month plus a reimbursement of $300 for gas. When the parties married, they talked\nabout petitioner working. Respondent told her that she did not have to work, as he \u201c[would] always\ntake care of [her].\u201d Petitioner relied on respondent\u2019s oral promise.\n\u00b6 10 After the parties married, petitioner\u2019s health deteriorated. She indicated that she is unable\nto work given her illnesses.1 Petitioner elaborated that she has secondary progressive MS, lupus,\nand lymphoma. Because her MS has gotten worse, she now wears leg braces every day. She is\nconfined to a wheelchair and will soon be using the services of a home healthcare caregiver to\nshower. Her lupus, which attacks the joints, causes her constant pain. She takes strong\nmedications, including morphine, to help alleviate the pain. She also takes a chemotherapy drug\ntwice a day to treat her lymphoma. The chemotherapy drugs cause her to vomit often. Although\n1 Respondent objected to petitioner\u2019s claim that she could not work because of her illnesses,\nas she was not qualified to make such an assessment. The court allowed her to testify as to her\nbelief, explaining that it would give her statements the appropriate weight.\n- 3 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\npetitioner applied for disability, her claim was denied. She has since retained an attorney to appeal\nthat decision.\n\u00b6 11 When the court dissolved the parties\u2019 marriage, it noted that respondent\u2019s yearly income\nwas $97,560 and petitioner\u2019s was $29,268. It awarded petitioner sole exclusive possession of the\nmarital home and ordered respondent to pay petitioner $500 per month for 22 months as her\nequitable share in the Wisconsin home.2\n\u00b6 12 The court considered all of the proper factors in deciding whether to award petitioner\nmaintenance. See 750 ILCS 5/504(a) (West 2018). The court found that no evidence corroborated\npetitioner\u2019s claim that her illnesses prevented her from working. The court observed that, although\npetitioner needed a wheelchair, which she had needed when the parties married, she was neatly\ndressed and well groomed. She also testified clearly and concisely and understood the questions\nposed to her. The court also noted that petitioner had been denied disability and that her only\nimpairment to working was her wheelchair. Moreover, the court observed that respondent\u2019s\npromise to take care of petitioner forever was not memorialized.\n\u00b6 13 Additionally, the court found petitioner\u2019s \u201cincome is shady,\u201d and her \u201ccredibility as to her\nfinances is poor, at best.\u201d The court continued that petitioner\u2019s financial circumstances were\n\u201ccircumspect,\u201d noting that she \u201cwas not being honest and forthcoming with her finances.\u201d For\ninstance, the court questioned from where petitioner received $1100 per month in monetary gifts\nand doubted that she drove over 1600 miles per month as she claimed in her financial affidavit.\nThe court found that petitioner\u2019s \u201cnumbers don\u2019t add up.\u201d Given petitioner\u2019s lack of credibility,\nthe short duration of the marriage, the fact that petitioner had at least $110,000 in equity in her\n2 The parties stipulated that petitioner\u2019s house was her nonmarital property.\n- 4 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\nhome, and she will receive $11,000 from respondent as her equity in the Wisconsin home, the\ncourt denied petitioner permanent maintenance, noting that the previously ordered award of $2099\nin monthly maintenance would continue for 11 months.\n\u00b6 14 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 15 At issue in this appeal is whether petitioner should have been awarded permanent\nmaintenance. Because the trial court has the discretion to award maintenance, we will not disturb\nthe trial court\u2019s maintenance award absent an abuse of discretion. In re Marriage of Sturm, 2012\nIL App (4th) 110559, \u00b6 3. A trial court abuses its discretion only if no reasonable person would\nadopt the trial court\u2019s view. Id.\n\u00b6 16 When a party challenges a trial court\u2019s factual findings concerning maintenance, we will\nnot reverse those findings unless they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. Findings\nare against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite conclusion is clearly evident or\nwhere the court\u2019s findings are unreasonable, arbitrary, and not based on any of the evidence. In re\nMarriage of Nord, 402 Ill. App. 3d 288, 294 (2010).\n\u00b6 17 \u201cQuestions of witness credibility and conflicting evidence are matters for the trial [court]\nto resolve.\u201d In re Marriage of Sturm, 2012 IL App (4th) 110559, \u00b6 6. \u201cBecause [the trial court]\nsees and hears the witnesses, [it] is in a position superior to a reviewing court for assessing their\ndemeanor, judging their credibility, and weighing the evidence.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 18 Section 504(a) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (750 ILCS 5/504(a)\n(West 2018)) provides that a court may award maintenance upon consideration of \u201call relevant\nfactors,\u201d including:\n- 5 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\n\u201c(1) the income and property of each party, including marital property apportioned\nand non-marital property assigned to the party seeking maintenance as well as all financial\nobligations imposed on the parties as a result of the dissolution of marriage;\n(2) the needs of each party;\n(3) the realistic present and future earning capacity of each party;\n(4) any impairment of the present and future earning capacity of the party seeking\nmaintenance due to that party devoting time to domestic duties or having forgone or\ndelayed education, training, employment, or career opportunities due to the marriage;\n5) any impairment of the realistic present and future earning capacity of the party\nagainst whom maintenance is sought;\n(6) the time necessary to enable the party seeking maintenance to acquire\nappropriate education, training, and employment, and whether that party is able to support\nhimself or herself through appropriate employment;\n(6.1) the effect of any parental responsibility arrangements and its effect of a party\u2019s\nability to seek or maintain employment;\n(7) the standard of living established during the marriage;\n(8) the duration of the marriage;\n(9) the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational\nskills, employability, estate, liabilities, and the needs of each of the parties;\n(10) all sources of public and private income including, without limitation,\ndisability and retirement income;\n(11) the tax consequences of each party;\n- 6 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\n(12) contributions and services by the party seeking maintenance to the education,\ntraining, career or career potential, or license of the other spouse;\n(13) any valid agreement between the parties; and\n(14) any other factor that the court expressly finds to be just and equitable.\u201d\n\u00b6 19 Although maintenance is designed to be temporary, providing a dependent spouse with\nsome support until that spouse is financially independent, permanent maintenance is appropriate\nin some circumstances. In re Marriage of Haas, 215 Ill. App. 3d 959, 964 (1991). For example,\n\u201c \u2018[p]ermanent maintenance *** is appropriate where it is evident that the recipient spouse is either\nunemployable or employable only at an income that is substantially lower than the previous\nstandard of living.\u2019 \u201d In re Marriage of Brankin, 2012 IL App (2d) 110203, \u00b6 9 (quoting In re\nMarriage of Murphy, 359 Ill. App. 3d 289, 303 (2005)).\n\u00b6 20 With these principles in mind, we turn to the issue raised in this appeal. In doing so, we\ncertainly are sympathetic to petitioner\u2019s poor health and her physical limitations. However, as\nnoted, our function as a court of review is limited. In that capacity, we conclude that the trial court\ndid not err.\n\u00b6 21 At the crux of the trial court\u2019s decision was its assessment of petitioner\u2019s credibility. The\ncourt found that petitioner was not credible in that she was neither honest nor forthcoming about\nher financial situation. The court\u2019s credibility finding was not against the manifest weight of the\nevidence.\n\u00b6 22 Moreover, given the trial court\u2019s findings, we are compelled to conclude that the court\u2019s\ndecision to deny petitioner permanent maintenance was not an abuse of discretion. Petitioner was\nawarded more assets than respondent; nothing indicated that the parties lived a lavish lifestyle; the\nmarriage lasted less than five years; and neither party was healthy. Although respondent allegedly\n- 7 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\npromised to always take care of petitioner, the court concluded that that promise was not valid.\nRespondent never testified that he made such a promise, and even if he had, it is difficult to\nconclude that respondent truly intended to take care of petitioner well after their relationship had\nsoured, rather than just during the marriage.\n\u00b6 23 Petitioner argues that she should have been awarded permanent maintenance, because both\nparties testified that she was disabled. We disagree. The fact that both parties believed that\npetitioner was disabled did not mean that the court had to accept that belief as fact. Moreover,\nrespondent was disabled too. The court noted during trial that it would afford the proper weight\nto testimony that petitioner was disabled, noting that no evidence other than the parties\u2019 testimony\nwas presented on that issue. See, e.g., Kraft Foods, Inc. v. Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board,\n2013 IL App (2d) 121031, \u00b6 58 (rejecting proposition that trier of fact must accept unrebutted\ntestimony); Franciscan Communities, Inc. v. Hamer, 2012 IL App (2d) 110431, \u00b6 47 (trier of fact\nfree to disbelieve any witness).\n\u00b6 24 We also find untenable petitioner\u2019s claim that the trial court failed to give the proper weight\nto the fact that she was disabled when the parties married; that the marriage lasted less than five\nyears; and that the parties\u2019 financial circumstances were vastly different. Putting aside the fact\nthat the court was not required to give equal weight to the statutory factors (In re Marriage of\nStam, 260 Ill. App. 3d 754, 756 (1994)), nothing indicated that the court failed to consider them.\nFor instance, although the court mentioned that petitioner already needed a wheelchair when she\nmarried respondent, we view the comment as the acknowledgement that the wheelchair did not\nprevent her from working, as petitioner testified that she and respondent discussed whether she\nwould work after the parties married. Similarly, we conclude that the court did not place too much\nweight on the fact that the parties\u2019 marriage lasted less than five years. Although the court\n- 8 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U\nmentioned the length of the marriage, nothing indicated that the court placed undue emphasis on\nthat factor. For the same reasons, we conclude that the court did not overlook the parties\u2019 allegedly\ndisparate financial circumstances. The court noted that respondent\u2019s gross monthly income\nexceeded petitioner\u2019s. However, it found that the difference did not warrant awarding petitioner\npermanent maintenance, as, among other things, petitioner\u2019s assets far exceeded respondent\u2019s, and\npetitioner\u2019s assessment of her finances was suspect given her inflated expenses and the\nquestionable source of some of her income.\n\u00b6 25 When we consider the entirety of the trial court\u2019s decision, we conclude that the court did\nnot improperly weigh the evidence in balancing all the relevant factors. The court\u2019s findings are\nnot against the manifest weight of the evidence (see Nord, 402 Ill. App. 3d at 294), and the court\ndid not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner permanent maintenance. See Strum, 2012 IL App\n(4th) 110559, \u00b6 3.\n\u00b6 26 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 27 For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of McHenry County.\n\u00b6 28 Affirmed.\n- 9 -",

DWYER, CLERK\nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\nSOVANNY PAL, No. 16-73460\nPetitioner, Agency No. A095-195-265\nv.\nMEMORANDUM*\nWILLIAM P. BARR, Attorney General,\nRespondent.\nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the\nBoard of Immigration Appeals\nSubmitted February 6, 2020**\nPasadena, California\nBefore: THOMAS, Chief Judge, and WARDLAW and NGUYEN, Circuit Judges.\nSovanny Pal petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s\n(\u201cBIA\u201d) dismissal of her appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) denial of her\napplication for adjustment of status based on the frivolous asylum bar.

See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition. Because the parties\nare familiar with the factual history of this proceeding we need not recount it here.\nWe review de novo whether the BIA properly applied the Matter of Y-L-, 24\nI & N Dec. 151, 155 (BIA 2007), framework in determining that Pal filed a\nfrivolous asylum application. See Kulakchyan v. Holder, 730 F.3d 993, 995 (9th\nCir. 2013) (per curiam). The BIA properly concluded that Pal had notice of the\nconsequences of filing a frivolous application, and its specific finding that she\ndeliberately fabricated the application was supported by a preponderance of the\nevidence; Pal was also given the opportunity to explain the discrepancies in her\napplication. Id. n.1.\nPal had notice of the consequences when she signed her asylum application\nbeneath a bold-print warning of the consequences of filing a frivolous application\nand when she affirmed that she was aware of those consequences at her asylum\ninterview. See Cheema v. Holder, 693 F.3d 1045, 1049 (9th Cir. 2012); see also\nKulakchyan, 730 F.3d at 995. The BIA\u2019s specific finding that Pal filed a frivolous\napplication is supported by substantial evidence, including the fact that Pal\nrenewed her fabricated application after she purportedly knew of its contents. See\nAhir v. Mukasey, 527 F.3d 912, 918 (9th Cir. 2008). The record indicates that both\nthe initial IJ before whom Pal appeared and the BIA sufficiently notified Pal that\n2her application would likely be considered frivolous, and she had the opportunity\nto submit additional materials to refute a frivolousness finding.\nWe deny Pal\u2019s petition as to her due process claim that she did not have\nadequate notice and opportunity to respond to the allegations of frivolousness. Cf.\nKulakchyan, 730 F.3d at 996 (holding that the petitioner had \u201cseveral months to\ncraft her explanation in response\u201d to the government\u2019s motion to pretermit her\napplication for asylum based on the frivolous asylum bar, and this time period gave\nher a sufficient opportunity to respond).\nWe lack jurisdiction to consider Pal\u2019s claim that her due process rights were\nviolated by inadequate translation at her asylum interviews because she did not\nexhaust her administrative remedies.

Kessler went\ninside the home to speak with his niece, leaving Leonard outside. After\nspeaking with his niece, Kessler discovered that his car and Leonard were\ngone. Shortly thereafter, Leonard returned with Kessler\u2019s car and ran away.\n____________________________________________\n* Retired Senior Judge assigned to the Superior Court.\n1 We note that by filing three separate notices of appeal from each docket\nbelow, Leonard has complied with the dictates of Commonwealth v. Walker,\n185 A.3d 969 (Pa. 2018), which held that \u201cwhere a single order resolves issues\narising on more than one docket, separate notices of appeal must be filed for\neach of those cases.\u201d Id. at 977. See also Pa.R.A.P. 341(a).\n2 We have sua sponte consolidated the three cases below for purposes of\nappeal. See Pa.R.A.P. 513 (\u201c[W]here the same question is involved in two or\nmore appeals in different cases, the appellate court may, in its discretion,\norder them to be argued together in all particulars as if but a single appeal.\u201d).\n- 2 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nKessler locked the car and started to walk to a nearby APlus convenience store\nto purchase snacks for the camping trip. Leonard rejoined Kessler on the way\nand Kessler asked Leonard why Leonard took his car. Leonard said, \u201cHe just\nneeded to go somewhere real quick that it was no big deal he brought it right\nback.\u201d See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19, Vol. I at 18-19.\nThe three men spent the rest of the day camping and eventually went\nto sleep in a tent. The next morning, Kessler briefly woke up when Davin left\nearly for work. Later that morning, Kessler awoke again and discovered that\nhis car keys were missing and that Leonard was gone. Kessler then went to\nthe police station and reported his car stolen to Officer Brian Harvey of the\nCity of Connellsville Police Department.\nOn the same morning, Leonard arrived at a home occupied by brothers\nCharles and Robert Travis, their mother, their sister, Johnathan Nesbit,\nRobert\u2019s minor son, and Nesbit\u2019s minor son. Charles Travis gave Leonard\npermission to sleep in the living room for the day, but forbade him from\nleaving the living room. After some members of the household left the house,\nLeonard left the home. When the children returned home from school, they\nreported that various items were missing from their bedrooms, including an\nXbox One console, multiple video games, controllers, knives, two BB guns, an\niPod, a laptop, a laptop charger, a gift card, a vaporizer, and a book bag. After\nCharles Travis found out about the missing items, he texted Leonard to inquire\nabout them.\n- 3 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nThat afternoon, David Lynn was driving down a one-way alley in front\nof the Community Center in Connellsville, when a 1997 white Geo Prizm struck\nLynn\u2019s vehicle head-on. After the collision, the driver of the Geo Prizm, later\nidentified as Leonard, drove away from the scene. Lynn followed the vehicle\nand found the Geo Prizm abandoned on Fairview Avenue. Later that day, Lynn\ncontacted the police about the incident. Corporal Andrew Hominsky went to\nFairview Avenue to recover the damaged vehicle. Corporal Hominsky\ndiscovered that the damaged vehicle was the same vehicle that Kessler had\nreported stolen earlier that day to Officer Harvey. The damage to the vehicle\nwas consistent with the details of the collision that Lynn had described.\nThat evening, an employee of the Carnegie Free Library in Connellsville\nreported the presence of a suspicious person. Office Harvey and Lieutenant\nTom Patton responded to the call and found Leonard asleep in the library\u2019s\ncomputer room with a variety of items surrounding him, including an Xbox\nOne console, BB guns, and a book bag containing knives, controllers, and\nclothing. Officer Harvey took Leonard to the police station for questioning\nabout the stolen vehicle. After Leonard waived his Miranda3 rights, Leonard\ngave the officers access to text messages on his cell phone between himself\nand Kessler. The text messages showed that Leonard asked Kessler not to\n____________________________________________\n3 Miranda v. Arizona, 84 U.S. 436 (1966).\n- 4 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\npress charges against him and that he would return the car with an additional\n$200.00 dollars.\nWhile processing Leonard\u2019s belongings, Leonard\u2019s phone received a text\nmessage from an unknown number saying, \u201cI believe that you are the one\nthat took the last game system from our house.\u201d See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19,\nVol. I at 81. Lieutenant Patton used Facebook to identify the number as one\nbelonging to Charles Travis. Lieutenant Patton told Charles Travis that\nLeonard was at the station with a variety of items and asked him to come in\nto identify them. Robert Travis, Johnathan Nesbit, their sons, and Charles\nTravis came to the station. Without prior knowledge of what items were\nrecovered, the boys correctly identified the game system as an Xbox One with\nunique stickers, the appearance of the BB guns, and the other items recovered\nfrom Leonard.\nLeonard was charged in three separate cases: No. 1006 of 2018\n(accidents involving damage to attended vehicle or property4 and driving\nwithout a license5); No. 1007 of 2018 (theft by unlawful taking6 and receiving\n____________________________________________\n4 75 Pa.

Leonard waived his\narraignment on June 15, 2018, and proceeded to a jury trial. On March 5,\n2019, a jury found Leonard guilty of the above-cited crimes.9 On March 14,\n2019, the court sentenced Leonard to 22 to 48 months of incarceration.\nLeonard timely filed a notice of appeal and court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b)\nconcise statement of errors complained of on appeal. On appeal, Leonard\npresents the following issues for our review:\n(1) Did the trial court err in consolidating the three (3) cases\nand, thereafter, holding a trial thereon?\n(2) Did the Commonwealth fail to present sufficient evidence to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Leonard] exercised\nunlawful control over an [Xbox] One, video games, two BB\nguns, knives, and iPod, a laptop, a laptop charger, a gift\ncard, a [vaporizer], and a book bag?\n(3) Did the Commonwealth fail to present sufficient evidence to\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Leonard] unlawfully\ntook a 1997 Geo [Prizm] from its owner?\n____________________________________________\n7 18 Pa. C.S.A \u00a7 3925.\n8 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 4106(a)(1)(ii).\n9 At No. 1008 of 2018, Leonard was acquitted of two counts each of theft by\nunlawful taking and RSP.\n- 6 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 7.\nIn his first issue, Leonard contends that the trial court improperly\nconsolidated his three cases for trial. Specifically, he argues that consolidation\n\u201chighly prejudiced [him] to the point where he could not receive a fair trial\n[and where] the jury could have improperly inferred guilt based upon the trial\ncourt\u2019s decision to try all three cases at one time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 10.\nOn May 23, 2018, the Commonwealth filed a notice of its intent to\nconsolidate Leonard\u2019s three cases in writing with the clerk of courts, and\nserved it on Leonard\u2019s attorney in compliance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 582. Leonard\nfailed to respond, object to or file a motion to sever the cases prior to trial.\nThus, we find the issue waived. See Commonwealth v. Berryman, 649\nA.2d 961, 973 (Pa. Super. 1994) (\u201c[W]e note that issues, even those of\nconstitutional dimension[,] are waived if not raised in the trial court.\u201d)\n(citations omitted); see also Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower\ncourt are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).10\nIn his second issue, Leonard contends that the Commonwealth failed to\npresent sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for theft by unlawful\ntaking of an Xbox One console, multiple video games, two BB guns, knives,\nan iPod, a laptop, a laptop charger, a gift card, a vaporizer, and a book bag.\n____________________________________________\n10 Even if we did not find the issue waived, we would conclude that it is\nmeritless. Here, the cases were properly consolidated where the offenses\nwere based upon the same transaction. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 582(A)(1)(b).\n- 7 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nSpecifically, Leonard argues that the Commonwealth failed to show that he\nexercised unlawful control over those items because Robert Travis sold those\nitems to him.\nOur standard for reviewing a sufficiency claim is whether \u201cthe factfinder\nreasonably could have determined all the elements of the crime were\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Commonwealth v. Pitner, 928\nA.2d 1104, 1108 (Pa. Super. 2007) (citations omitted). Unless the evidence\nwas so weak and inconclusive that no probability of fact could be drawn from\nthat evidence, the factfinder determines the weight of the evidence at trial.\nId. Accordingly, this Court must view all the evidence and reasonable\ninferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. Id.\nAn individual is guilty of theft by unlawful taking when \u201che unlawfully\ntakes, or exercises unlawful control over, movable property of another with\nintent to deprive him thereof.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921(a). \u201cMovable property\u201d\nis defined as \u201cproperty of which location can be changed.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\n3901. Finally, \u201cdeprivation\u201d occurs if a person \u201cwithhold[s] property of\nanother permanently\u201d or \u201cdispose[s] of the property so as to make it unlikely\nthat the owner will recover it.\u201d Id.\nIn Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 509 A.2d 868, 871 (Pa. Super. 1984),\nour Court concluded that sufficient evidence existed to sustain a defendant\u2019s\nconviction for theft by unlawful taking where the defendant was found in\npossession of the stolen item. Additional evidence such as the unique features\n- 8 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nof the moveable property and the short period of time between the theft and\nthe defendant being apprehended further supported the conviction. Id.\nSimilarly, here, Nesbit testified that Leonard was left alone in the house\non the day the items were stolen. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19, Vol. I at 66.\nWhen the children returned home that day, they reported the missing items.\nId. at 67. Officer Harvey and Lieutenant Patton testified that they found\nLeonard in the Carnegie Library computer room surrounded by the stolen\nitems later that same day. Id. at 80; N.T. Jury Trial, 3/5/19, Vol. II at 22.\nWithout being given any information about the items, the children were able\nto describe unique features of the items found with Leonard that only\nindividuals familiar with the items would know. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19,\nVol. I at 81-82.\nNothing in the record suggests these items were sold to Leonard or that\nLeonard had permission to take these items.11 In fact, Charles Travis, Robert\nTravis, and Johnathan Nesbit all testified that they did not give Leonard\npermission to take these items or to go in the bedrooms. See id. at 54-55,\n57, 69.\nSimilar to the situation in Lloyd, the police found Leonard in possession\nof the stolen items the same day the items were stolen and the owners of\n____________________________________________\n11 In his appellate brief, Leonard claims that he testified the owners sold him\nthe items. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 9. However, Leonard never took the stand at\ntrial.\n- 9 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nitems were able to identify their property by their unique characteristics. See\nN.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19, Vol. I at 80-82. Furthermore, there is more evidence\nof the unlawful taking in the present case than in Lloyd because Leonard had\na clear opportunity to steal the items when he was left inside the home\nunsupervised. See Id. at 66. By contrast, in Lloyd, the defendant took the\nproperty from a barn in the middle of the night and had no connection to the\nvictim. Lloyd, supra at 869-70.\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth,\nthe evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that Leonard\nunlawfully possessed the items. Pitner, supra. The fact finder could have\ndetermined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Leonard unlawfully possessed\nthose items where the record shows Leonard was left unsupervised in the\nTravis house, the items were taken from an area Leonard was specifically\nprohibited from accessing, Leonard did not have permission to possess the\nitems, and Leonard was found in possession of the items later that same day.\nAccordingly, this claim is meritless.\nIn his third issue, Leonard contends that the Commonwealth failed to\npresent sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for theft by unlawful\ntaking regarding Kessler\u2019s Geo Prizm. Specifically, Leonard contends that the\nCommonwealth failed to show that he exercised unlawful control over the\n- 10 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nvehicle12 because the eyewitness who identified Leonard driving the vehicle\non the date of the accident was not credible.13\nIn Commonwealth v. Galvin, 985 A.2d 783, 791 (Pa. 2009), the\nSupreme Court concluded that sufficient evidence existed to sustain the\ndefendant\u2019s conviction for theft by un-lawful taking, where the defendant\ndrove the vehicle without the owner\u2019s permission, even when he had been\ngiven permission to drive the vehicle on previous occasions.\nHere, Kessler testified that on the morning of March 19, 2018, he was\ncamping with Leonard and his brother Davin. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19,\nVol. I at 19. After Davin left early for work, Leonard and Kessler were left\nalone and Kessler went back to sleep. Id. When Kessler woke up, he\ndiscovered that his car keys were missing and Leonard was gone. Id. at 20.\nKessler reported the vehicle stolen to the police and testified that he did not\ngive Leonard permission to drive his vehicle. Id. at 21.\n____________________________________________\n12 In his appellate brief, Leonard claims he testified at trial that he had\npermission to use the vehicle. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 9. However, as we already\nnoted, see supra at n.11, Leonard never took the stand at trial.\n13 We point out that the credibility of a witness\u2019s identification is solely the\nprovince of the fact finder and is not considered by this court when evaluating\nthe sufficiency of the evidence. Pitner, 928 A.2d at 1108. Here, Lynn\nidentified Leonard in court as the driver of the vehicle, which was later\nidentified as Kessler\u2019s 1997 Geo Prizm. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19, Vol. I at\n40. The jury resolved any issue of the credibility of Lynn\u2019s identification at\ntrial. As such, the credibility of Lynn\u2019s identification is not considered when\ndetermining the sufficiency of the evidence.\n- 11 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nLater that day, Lynn was involved in a head-on collision with a white\n1997 Geo Prizm, which was the same make, model and year of Kessler\u2019s\nmissing vehicle. Id. at 73. Lynn positively identified Leonard as the driver in\ncourt. Id. at 40. When the police impounded the vehicle after the accident,\nCorporal Hominsky identified the vehicle as Kessler\u2019s vehicle. Id. at 73.\nAdditionally, at the police station, Leonard gave the police access to text\nmessages between himself and Kessler where Leonard admitted to taking the\nvehicle. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/5/19, Vol. II at 23.\nSimilar to the situation in Galvin, supra, the Commonwealth presented\nsufficient evidence to prove Leonard unlawfully took possession of the owner\u2019s\nvehicle. As in Galvin, where the defendant was driving a vehicle without\npermission, Lynn saw Leonard drive Kessler\u2019s vehicle after Kessler reported\nthe vehicle stolen. See N.T. Jury Trial, 3/4/19, Vol. I at 40. Moreover, Kessler\ntestified he did not give Leonard permission, and Kessler reported the vehicle\nas stolen. Id. at 21, 31.\nThere was sufficient evidence at trial for the jury to conclude that\nLeonard exercised unlawful control, and, thus, unlawfully possessed the 1997\nGeo Prizm, where the Commonwealth presented evidence that Leonard did\nnot have permission to drive the vehicle, Leonard got into an accident while\ndriving the vehicle, and Leonard confessed to taking the vehicle in text\nmessages between himself and Kessler. Therefore, this claim fails.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n- 12 -J-S68019-19\nJ-S68020-19\nJ-S68021-19\nJudgment Entered.\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\nDate: 2/10/2020\n- 13 -",

    "text": "NOT PRECEDENTIAL\nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS\nFOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT\n______________\nNo. 19-2174\n______________\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nv.\nLAVON CALDWELL,\nAppellant\n______________\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Middle District of Pennsylvania\n(D.C. Criminal No. 4-18-cr-00041-001)\nDistrict Judge: Honorable Matthew W. Brann\n______________\nSubmitted Under Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a)\nJanuary 14, 2020\n______________\nBefore: JORDAN, GREENAWAY, JR., and KRAUSE, Circuit Judges.\n(Opinion Filed: February 10, 2020)\n______________OPINION*\n______________\nGREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judge.\nOn May 8, 2019, following Appellant Lavon Caldwell\u2019s guilty plea for possession\nof a weapon while incarcerated, the District Court sentenced him to 12 months\u2019\nimprisonment. Caldwell appeals that sentence on the grounds that the District Court\nfailed to consider and apply the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\nThe record, however, shows the contrary, and we will affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nOn March 7, 2017, correctional officers conducted a pat-down search of Caldwell.\nDuring that search, the officers found two wooden shanks of approximately six and seven\ninches long on Caldwell\u2019s person. A grand jury subsequently indicted Caldwell for\npossession of contraband in prison in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). Caldwell pled\nguilty to that offense, and the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his\nguideline range as 18 to 24 months. PSR \u00b6 56.\nThe District Court sentenced Caldwell to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the\nsentencing hearing, the District Court considered granting a downward departure\npursuant to \u00a7 5K2.0, and it discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In favor of entering a below-\nguidelines sentence, the District Court noted Caldwell\u2019s difficult childhood, his physical\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.\n2and mental illnesses, his participation in various self-improvement programs, and his\nrelatively few instances of prison misconduct. Although the District Court did not\ndiscuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in detail, it expressly noted that it had considered all\nof them. The District Court then imposed a sentence of 12 months\u2019 imprisonment to run\nconsecutively to his previous sentence.\nCaldwell then requested that the Court increase his sentence by one day, which\nwould make him eligible for nearly two months of time credits, effectively lowering his\nsentence by two months.1 Acknowledging that it had \u201canticipated . . . that request\u201d and\nhad given it \u201cconsiderable thought,\u201d the District Court decided that \u201cthe full 12 months[]\nis the appropriate sentence.\u201d App. 21. Accordingly, the District Court denied Caldwell\u2019s\nrequest.\nII. STATEMENT OF JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OR REVIEW\nThe District Court had jurisdiction over this case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231.\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).\nWe review a criminal sentence in \u201ctwo stages.\u201d United States v. Tomko, 562 F.3d\n558, 567 (3d Cir. 2009) (en banc). First, we review for procedural error \u201csuch as failing\nto calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as\nmandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly\n1 Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b), a prisoner serving a term of imprisonment of more\nthan one year and less than life may be eligible for credit that would reduce the remaining\ntime on the prisoner\u2019s sentence.\n3erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an\nexplanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d Gall v. United States, 552\nU.S. 38, 51 (2007). \u201cIf we find procedural error \u2018our preferred course is to remand the\ncase for re-sentencing, without going any further.\u2019\u201d United States v. Negroni, 638 F.3d\n434, 443 (3d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Merced, 603 F.3d 203, 214 (3d Cir.\n2010)). Second, if we find no procedural error, we review for substantive reasonableness\nand will \u201caffirm [the sentence] unless no reasonable sentencing court would have\nimposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court\nprovided.\u201d Tomko, 562 F.3d at 567. At both stages we review for abuse of discretion.\nNegroni, 638 F.3d at 443.\nIII. DISCUSSION\nCaldwell makes both a procedural and a substantive challenge to his sentence.\nFirst, he argues that his sentence is procedurally unsound because the District Court did\nnot properly weigh all seven \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Second, he contends that his sentence is\nsubstantively unreasonable because the sentence precludes him from earning credit\ntowards service of his sentence. Neither argument is availing.\nAs to Caldwell\u2019s procedural challenge, we read the record differently than he does.\nContrary to Caldwell\u2019s argument, the District Court stated explicitly that it considered\n\u201call seven factors as set forth at Title 18 of the United States Code at Section 3553(a).\u201d\nApp. 20. In fact, the District Court explained how the factors supported its ultimate\n4decision to grant Caldwell\u2019s motion for a downward departure, noting his \u201crehabilitative\nefforts, his generally mild prison conduct, and the other Section 3553 factors that I have\nmentioned.\u201d App. 20. Although the District Court did not make findings as to each\nfactor, the case law in this Circuit is clear that the District Court did not need to do so.\nSee United States v. Handerhan, 739 F.3d 114, 122\u201324 (3d Cir. 2014) (finding that the\nDistrict Court did not commit procedural error in sentencing despite not discussing in\ndetail all seven \u00a7 3553 factors). Accordingly, we find Caldwell\u2019s procedural challenge\nunconvincing.\nAs to Caldwell\u2019s substantive challenge, we disagree that a sentence of 12 months\nis unreasonable in comparison to a sentence of 10 months, which he effectively would\nhave served, assuming good behavior, had he been sentenced to 12 months and a day.\nThe only circumstance under which we would vacate a sentence for substantive reasons\nis if \u201cno reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that\nparticular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d United States v. Wright,\n642 F.3d 148, 152 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the sentence imposed by the District Court is\nentirely reasonable, and we find no basis to disturb it. This sentence does not amount to\nan abuse of discretion. The substantive challenge is therefore without merit.\nIV. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction imposed by\nthe District Court.\n5",

Wasden, Attorney General; Kenneth K. Jorgensen, Deputy\nAttorney General, Boise, for appellant. Kenneth K. Jorgensen argued.\nEric D. Fredericksen, State Appellate Public Defender; Jason C. Pintler, Deputy\nAppellate Public Defender, Boise, for respondent. Jason C. Pintler argued.\n________________________________________________\nGRATTON, Judge\nThe State appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment reducing Tyler Anthony Howell\u2019s\nconviction for felony sexual abuse of a child under the age of sixteen years, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-\n1506, to a conviction of misdemeanor indecent exposure, I.C. \u00a7 18-4116. The State asserts the\ndistrict court erred by setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict because the evidence was sufficient to\nsupport the felony conviction. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the district court\u2019s\norder, vacate the judgment, reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict, and remand for sentencing on the crime\nof conviction.\n1I.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nS.P. took her eight-year-old granddaughter, L.K., to lunch at a local fast food restaurant.\nThey sat at a round booth; L.K. was facing the windows while her grandmother sat facing her.\nNear the windows of the restaurant there were tables and chairs that were higher than the booths.\nS.P. said her granddaughter was often distracted during their lunch and she had to encourage her\nto eat. S.P. said L.K. was particularly distracted by the area behind her, where a man was seated\nnear the window. This man was later identified as Howell.\nAs S.P. left with L.K., the child told her that \u201c[Howell\u2019s] pee-pee was out of his pants.\u201d\nShortly after returning home, L.K. drew a picture of what she saw. She later recreated a similar\ndrawing for a detective. Surveillance video from the restaurant was given to the police and still\nimages show Howell exposing his penis to L.K. The video also shows Howell repeatedly reach\nbetween his legs and manipulate his genitals while L.K. looks in his direction. A detective\ninterviewed Howell who admitted he was at the restaurant, had seen L.K., but did not remember\nexposing himself. However, Howell did not deny exposing himself when pressed. The State\ncharged Howell with sexual abuse of a minor by causing L.K. to witness him rubbing his\ngenitals.\nAt trial, the surveillance video was admitted and L.K. testified. When asked if she\nwitnessed Howell \u201chold\u201d or \u201ctouch\u201d his penis she responded \u201cNo.\u201d1 Howell moved for acquittal\nafter the State\u2019s case-in-chief.2 He argued the evidence only showed he had exposed himself to\nL.K. and, based on her testimony, she had not witnessed an act of sexual conduct that is required\nfor conviction under the statute. The State responded there was \u201cmore than enough evidence to\nshow that while [L.K.] was present and while she was looking at [Howell], he had his hand down\nin the area of his exposed penis [and] he was moving it up and down.\u201d The district court denied\nthe motion. The jury was given instructions which incorporated the lesser included offense of\nindecent exposure. After trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict of felony sexual abuse of a child\n1 Q: Did you ever see [Howell] hold his penis?\nA: No.\nQ: Did you ever see [Howell] touch his penis?\nA: No.\n2 Idaho Criminal Rule 29(a).\n2under the age of sixteen, and Howell again moved for acquittal.3 Howell argued that although\nthe video shows L.K. may have had the opportunity to witness sexual conduct, it did not show\nshe witnessed it in fact because \u201c[y]ou can\u2019t know what someone saw by watching a video.\u201d The\ndistrict court granted the motion, holding that because L.K. testified she saw Howell\u2019s genitals\nbut did not see him touch or rub the area, the evidence could only support a conviction for\nindecent exposure. The district court entered judgment for the lesser included misdemeanor\noffense. The State timely appeals.\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nIdaho Criminal Rule 29(c) permits the court, on motion of the defendant, to set aside the\nverdict and enter judgment of acquittal after a verdict of guilty is returned. In reviewing the\ndenial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, the appellate court must independently consider the\nevidence in the record and determine whether a reasonable mind could conclude that the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt as to each material element of the offense was proven beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. State v. Gonzalez, 134 Idaho 907, 909, 12 P.3d 382, 384 (Ct. App. 2000). We will not\nsubstitute our view for that of the jury as to the credibility of the witnesses, the weight to be\ngiven to the testimony, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. State v.\nKnutson, 121 Idaho 101, 104, 822 P.2d 998, 1001 (Ct. App. 1991); State v. Decker, 108 Idaho\n683, 684, 701 P.2d 303, 304 (Ct. App. 1985). Moreover, we will consider the evidence in the\nlight most favorable to the prosecution. State v. Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho 383, 385, 957 P.2d\n1099, 1101 (Ct. App. 1998); Knutson, 121 Idaho at 104, 822 P.2d at 1001. We apply this same\nstandard of review on appeal from an order granting a motion for judgment of acquittal.\nGonzalez, 134 Idaho at 909, 12 P.3d at 384.\nIII.\nANALYSIS\nThe State claims the district court erred in granting Howell\u2019s motion for judgment of\nacquittal. Specifically, it argues the evidence sufficiently demonstrated an act of sexual conduct\nwhich is required to prove felony child abuse. I.C. \u00a7 18-1506. It asserts the district court\nincorrectly determined the victim\u2019s testimony contradicted the video because it is reasonable to\nbelieve the child witnessed sexual conduct, but because of her young age could not understand\n3 I.C.R. 29(c).\n3the concept. We conclude a reasonable jury could have determined that guilt had been proven as\nto each element, including sexual conduct.\nIdaho Code \u00a7 18-1506(1)(d) states it is a felony for a person to induce, cause, or permit a\nminor child to witness an act of sexual conduct. Sexual conduct means human masturbation or\nany touching of the genitals or pubic areas. I.C. \u00a7 18-1506(4). When Howell motioned the\ndistrict court for judgment of acquittal, the district court was tasked with assessing whether the\nevidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction to support the verdict. Evidence is sufficient if\nthere is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the\nprosecution sustained its burden of proving the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable\ndoubt. Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho at 385, 957 P.2d at 1101; Knutson, 121 Idaho at 104, 822 P.2d\nat 1001.\nThe State presented evidence that included testimony from L.K., Deputy Kelch,\nDetective Strolberg, and the restaurant surveillance video. L.K. confirmed she saw Howell\u2019s\ngenitals but denied having seen him touch or rub the area. She also denied seeing him open and\nclose his legs in order to hide his genitals from other customers in the restaurant but when\npressed clarified that she did not remember. Deputy Kelch testified to what he observed, which\nhe believed to be sexual conduct on the surveillance video:\nSo initially as he pulled [his penis] out--or kind of rubbed up on it, up and\ndown, and then as he sat there, he would open his legs when the little girl was in\ndirect view throughout the time as she ate.\nShe was interacting with other kids in the restaurant, talking to her\ngrandmother. So the opening of the legs happened only when she was kinda\nlooking in his direction.\n. . . .\n[W]hile she\u2019s [at the restaurant] you can see him repeatedly going down into his\ngroin area and then opening the legs multiple times.\nDetective Strolberg also testified to what she believed to be a connection between the sexual\nconduct and L.K.\u2019s attention:\nQ: Specifically, what was it that you noticed?\nA: When [Howell] had her attention and no one else was viewing him, he had\nhis legs spread apart with his penis showing.\n. . . .\nQ: Okay. And were there times intermittently during this period of time\nwhere he would touch or manipulate his penis?\nA: Yes.\n4When asked on redirect to confirm whether the video depicted Howell engaging in sexual\nconduct, the court interjected that it did not want \u201ctoo many more questions on that, counsel.\nThe video is in evidence and the jury will be making its own conclusions about what it sees.\u201d\nThe jury did just that, returning a guilty verdict.4 The district court, however, determined\nthe evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate L.K. had witnessed sexual conduct, and stated:\nIt\u2019s just that this evidence does not support that offense in 100 percent; [it]\nsupports [the] included offense of indecent exposure.\n. . . .\nI can\u2019t disregard the evidence and there wasn\u2019t any evidence. The child herself\nsaid that\u2019s all she saw.\n. . . .\nAnd the fact that those of us watching the video might observe something\ndifferent than the child observed, doesn\u2019t cover that base because the elements of\nthe offense required the child to witness an act of sexual conduct when this case,\nwhich was alleged to be exposing his penis.\nThe child did not see that and she was really clear that she did not see that.\nShe saw him expose himself.\nThat means that the included offense of indecent exposure was\nconclusively established, but the secondary offense . . . is not established by the\nfacts in this case.\nIt is apparent from the video evidence that Howell\u2019s actions constitute sexual conduct; the only\nissue was whether a reasonable juror could have concluded, contrary to L.K.\u2019s testimony, that\nL.K. actually witnessed that conduct. The district court reweighed the evidence, analyzing\nwhether it believed the element of sexual conduct had been proven \u201cin 100 percent.\u201d The court\nneeded only address whether a reasonable jury could have concluded the element had been\nsatisfied.\nFrom our independent review of the evidence, we conclude that a reasonable jury could\nfind that each material element of the sexual abuse of a child offense was proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt. As an initial matter, despite L.K.\u2019s denial of witnessing manipulation of the\npenis, Howell\u2019s behavior on video provides a link to what L.K. saw. Howell appears to attempt\nto get the child\u2019s attention. When he thinks he has her looking his way he opens his legs and on\n4 Jury Instruction No. 5 reads:\nThe key part of your job as jurors is to decide how credible or believable\neach witness was. This is your job, not mine. It is up to you to decide if a\nwitness\u2019s testimony was believable, and how much weight you think it deserves.\nYou are free to believe everything that a witness said, or only part of it, or none of\nit at all.\n5some of those occasions holds and rubs his penis. It was not unreasonable for the jury to\nconclude, based on L.K.\u2019s age, that she witnessed Howell manipulating his genitals but could not\ndraw the inference as to what she was seeing or simply did not remember. Though L.K.\nresponded \u201cno\u201d when asked if she saw Howell hold or touch his penis the jury was entitled, as\nthe district court instructed at trial, to disbelieve portions of her testimony which were\ncontradicted by the video evidence and draw its own conclusions. For example, L.K. admitted\nnot remembering other acts that were clearly depicted in the surveillance video.5 L.K.\u2019s age and\nthe lapse of time between the incident and trial are all relevant and reasonable considerations\nwhich could affect the weight the jury gave her testimony.\nFurther, the jury was free to find, for any number of reasons, that her age and\ninexperience led her to testify contrary to the video evidence, or find she lacked the capacity to\nanswer the question beyond the most literal sense. The jury weighed the evidence and chose to\nrely more heavily on the video; which captured Howell masturbating while L.K. looked in his\ndirection. The jury was properly instructed on and rejected the lesser included offense of\nindecent exposure. The evidence, the inferences, and the jury\u2019s ability to weigh credibility\nsupport its verdict. The jury was not obligated to ignore the reasonable inferences it drew from\nthe video based upon the child\u2019s single response to a very limited inquiry. Accordingly, the trial\ncourt improvidently granted Howell\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nThe trial court erred in granting Howell\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. Thus, we\nreverse the district court\u2019s order, vacate the judgment, reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict, and remand for\nsentencing on the crime of conviction.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge LORELLO CONCUR.\n5 Q: And do you recall, would he put his legs together and then spread them apart?\nA: No.\nQ: Okay. You don\u2019t remember that?\nA: I don\u2019t remember that.\n6",

Bauknecht,\n) Judge Presiding.\nJUSTICE DeARMOND delivered the judgment of the court.\nPresiding Justice Steigmann and Justice Holder White concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\nHeld: The trial court did not abuse its discretion and considered all relevant factors in\naggravation and mitigation when sentencing defendant to six years in the Illinois\nDepartment of Corrections.\n\u00b6 1 In August 2015, as the result of a consensual search of defendant Gilberto\nPortuguez\u2019s residence conducted in December 2013, defendant was charged with unlawful\nproduction of cannabis sativa plants (720 ILCS 550/8(d) (West 2012)) in that he knowingly\npossessed more than 50 but not more than 200 cannabis plants, a Class 2 felony. Defendant, who\nrepresented himself at trial, was convicted by a jury of the single count. The trial court sentenced\ndefendant to six years in the Illinois Department of Corrections. Defendant then accepted\nrepresentation of counsel for purposes of filing a motion to reconsider his sentence, which was\nultimately denied.\u00b6 2 Defendant appeals his sentence, contending the trial court abused its discretion by\n(1) considering unverified criminal history records contained in the presentence investigation\nreport, (2) relying on unwarranted speculation that defendant intended to sell the cannabis found\nat his residence when deciding an appropriate sentence, and (3) failing to consider relevant\nmitigating factors in defendant\u2019s favor when fashioning his sentence. We affirm.\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 Based upon information received by the Livingston County Sheriff\u2019s Department,\nan investigator with the sheriff\u2019s office went to defendant\u2019s residence in December 2013 to\nconduct a \u201cknock and talk,\u201d wherein the officer sought to engage the resident in a conversation\nto determine whether he was willing to consent to a search of the residence. Upon his arrival,\ndefendant answered the door, acknowledged it was his residence, and ultimately admitted to\ngrowing cannabis, leading the investigator to an elaborate \u201ccannabis grow\u201d in his basement.\n\u00b6 5 The investigator, who then called for additional deputies, found 53 smaller\ncannabis plants in varying stages of growth, along with 58 larger plants at different growth\nstages. The growing area, which the investigator described as being \u201creally expensive,\u201d\ncontained chrome-colored walls to reflect light from \u201calmost like suntanning bulbs,\u201d attached to\ntimers. There were also \u201chuge Co2 can[n]isters\u201d of carbon dioxide, which were pumped into the\ngrowing areas to accelerate plant growth at various stages. They also found fans and a filtered\nventilation system intended to prevent the smell of cannabis from extending beyond the\nbasement. Based upon the investigator\u2019s knowledge and experience with \u201ccannabis grows,\u201d these\nthings were all evidence of an elaborate cannabis production operation for profit.\n\u00b6 6 As a result, defendant was charged with one count of unlawful production of\ncannabis sativa plants, a Class 2 felony, in August 2015. At his initial arraignment, defendant,\n- 2 -who later described himself as a \u201cpropera persona\u201d defendant, declined counsel, indicating he\nwished to represent himself. By the time of trial in May 2017, defendant had contested the\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction over him and argued he was not subject to criminal prosecution. Although\npresent throughout, he did not actively participate in the jury trial and did not testify in his own\nbehalf.\n\u00b6 7 The jury was instructed on the offense of unlawful possession of more than 50 but\nnot more than 200 cannabis sativa plants (Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions, Criminal, Nos. 17.11,\n17.12 (4th ed. 2000)), and the two verdict forms referenced unlawful possession of cannabis\nsativa plants only. No further mention was made of the actual charge of unlawful production.\nThe jury returned a verdict of guilty. Defendant was ordered to cooperate with the court services\ndepartment in the preparation of a presentence investigation report and remained free on bond\npending sentencing.\n\u00b6 8 At sentencing in September 2017, the presentence investigation report indicated\ndefendant, who also went by several aliases, had criminal identification numbers from Texas,\nCalifornia, Michigan, Georgia, and Florida, in addition to those from Illinois and the Federal\nBureau of Investigation. Defendant denied any arrests associated with Texas, California,\nMichigan, and Georgia. At the time the presentence investigation was being conducted,\ndefendant was awaiting trial in Cook County for manufacture/delivery of a controlled substance\n(cocaine).\n\u00b6 9 Known criminal convictions as an adult included unlawful possession of a\ncontrolled substance out of Cook County in December 1983, for which defendant received 2\nyears of probation; open carry of a weapon, resisting/obstructing without violence out of\nBroward County, Florida, in August 1992, for which defendant received 18 days in jail; criminal\n- 3 -drug conspiracy in Will County in March 1998, for which defendant received a 15-year sentence\nin the Department of Corrections; two different unlawful possession of controlled substances\ncases from Cook County in December 1996, resulting in 18 months of \u201cspecial\u201d probation and\n90 days in jail served concurrently with his 15-year sentence from Will County; another\nmanufacture/delivery of controlled substances from Cook County in October 1998, with a 6-year\nsentence served concurrently with his 15-year sentence from Will County; and unlawful\npossession of cannabis from Livingston County in October 2013, for which defendant received 1\nyear of conditional discharge and 2 days in jail.\n\u00b6 10 A list of nine offenses from Cook County for dates between 1972 through 1996\nwere noted, which defendant either said he did not recognize or believed were dismissed,\nnolle prosequi, or for which he was found not guilty. Four additional offenses were identified\nfrom Florida from 1981, 1988, and 1993, two of which defendant believed were dismissed. None\nof the nine Cook County cases or the four Florida cases were verified by court services.\n\u00b6 11 The presentence investigation report also indicated defendant tested positive for\nbenzodiazepine, heroin, methadone, morphine, and cocaine at his presentence interview on June\n6, 2017, approximately one week after being found guilty in this case. Defendant informed the\nreport writer he bought methadone \u201coff the street,\u201d using between 10-15 milliliters per day for\nsciatic nerve pain as well as arthritis in his knees. He acknowledged purchasing illegal\nsubstances for pain management, admitting to cannabis use since his twenties and cocaine usage\nsince he was 25. He said he started using heroin in his forties and used it daily until 1996, and he\nbegan snorting it in 2012. Defendant admitted the use of these substances continued until within\n\u201ca week\u201d or \u201ca couple months\u201d before he was interviewed. As a result, he was requested to\n- 4 -perform a drug test by the probation department when he appeared for sentencing on September\n19, 2017; however, he refused.\n\u00b6 12 Defendant admitted the growing of cannabis was both for his pain management\nand because it \u201cpays bills.\u201d The report writer noted, when asked by the police at the time of the\nsearch whether he sold the cannabis to make money, defendant told them this was his \u201cfirst time\u201d\nand that he did not get anything out of it because it takes \u201cthree months cycles\u201d to get going.\n\u00b6 13 When asked if he had \u201c[a]ny objection to the [presentence] report that was\ntendered\u201d or whether there was \u201cany information in there that you believe is incorrect or needs to\nbe clarified,\u201d defendant said, \u201cnope.\u201d\n\u00b6 14 The State recommended six years in the Illinois Department of Corrections,\nnoting defendant was convicted of a Class 2 felony, had a prior history of delinquency involving\nthe same type of charges, and that his character and demeanor were such that he would not be\nlikely to comply with a term of probation. The State pointed to the fact defendant continued to\nuse controlled substances even after being found guilty in this case and lied to the probation\ndepartment about how recent his drug use had been. It also noted, in the presentence report,\ndefendant sought to deny the cannabis plants were his. The State also argued deterrence was a\nmajor consideration when taking into account the \u201clarge scale production of cannabis sativa\nplants\u201d and argued probation would \u201cdeprecate the seriousness of the facts.\u201d\n\u00b6 15 Defendant asked for probation, in part, due to his ongoing medical issues. He also\ndenied lying to the probation department.\n\u00b6 16 The trial court began its discussion of what might constitute an appropriate\nsentence by observing, \u201cthe statute does direct the Court to consider probation as the first and\npreferred disposition unless it would deprecate the serious nature of the charges.\u201d The court said\n- 5 -there were a number of factors to be considered, including the evidence at trial, aggravating and\nmitigating factors set forth in the statute, defendant\u2019s own statements, the financial impact of a\nsentence, and \u201cother relevant statutory factors.\u201d Finding the aggravating factors outweighing\nthose in mitigation, the court noted defendant\u2019s prior record, acknowledging the extent of the\nrecord was a little confusing due to the existence of some unverified cases. Outlining defendant\u2019s\nperiods of incarceration, the court found there were apparently no convictions between 2003 and\n2013. However, defendant\u2019s criminal history indicated his involvement with drug-related\noffenses was long-standing. The court acknowledged, \u201cselling is not the charge here, but\nobviously, given the amount that we\u2019re dealing with I think that\u2019s a reasonable thing to be\nthinking about.\u201d As a result, the court indicated defendant\u2019s prior record with not only\npossession-related offenses, but also manufacturing or delivery of controlled substances, \u201cis a\npretty strong aggravating factor.\u201d The court also discussed the need for deterrence as a \u201cstrong\naggravating factor.\u201d The court recognized the number of plants made it appear less likely they\nwere for defendant\u2019s personal use.\n\u00b6 17 The trial court discussed factors in mitigation, observing, \u201c[t]here aren\u2019t very\nmany mitigating factors here.\u201d The court concluded defendant\u2019s ongoing medical condition was\nnot such that it would be endangered by imprisonment. The surgery defendant talked about\nduring the pendency of the case had already taken place, and he was now engaged in therapy,\nwhich could be conducted in the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n\u00b6 18 In summation, the trial court noted the \u201cvery serious offense,\u201d because defendant\nwas \u201ca person engaged in the production of cannabis sativa plants that appears to be an amount\nwell beyond personal use,\u201d and two aggravating factors \u201cthat really stand out, [defendant\u2019s] prior\nrecord as well as deterrence.\u201d Finding probation would deprecate the seriousness of the offense,\n- 6 -the court concluded the State\u2019s recommendation was appropriate, noting defendant had\npreviously been sentenced to prison for six years on a manufacturing/delivery charge, which did\nnot deter him from future criminal conduct. The court then imposed a sentence of six years in the\nIllinois Department of Corrections.\n\u00b6 19 During the trial court\u2019s admonishment of defendant\u2019s appeal rights, he indicated\nhis intention to appeal and accepted the appointment of the public defender to perfect a motion to\nreconsider the sentence in preparation for his appeal. Defendant\u2019s motion for reconsideration,\nfiled September 25, 2017, alleged the court failed to consider all mitigating factors, noting\nspecifically: (1) the offense was not a violent offense and defendant\u2019s conduct neither caused nor\nthreatened serious physical harm to another, nor did defendant contemplate that it would;\n(2) defendant led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before this conviction; (3) the\ncourt improperly considered a number of what defendant described as \u201cunverified, inaccurate\nand non-confirmed\u201d criminal offenses listed in the presentence investigation report; and (4) the\ncourt failed to consider defendant\u2019s advanced age and health. Defendant also contended the\nsentence imposed was an abuse of discretion, excessive, and disproportionate to the nature of the\noffense.\n\u00b6 20 At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the public defender focused primarily on\nmitigating factors he contended were not considered by the trial court, the prejudice caused by\nthe inclusion of various offenses for which there was no verifying information, and defendant\u2019s\nage and medical condition. The State pointed out a motion for reconsideration was not an\nopportunity to present new or additional arguments to the court. It noted the court was well\naware of defendant\u2019s age and medical condition and had noted the unverified criminal history\ninformation would not be considered, and the State pointed out that a substantial portion of the\n- 7 -time defense counsel attributed to law-abiding conduct was due to a 15-year prison sentence\ndefendant was serving.\n\u00b6 21 In denying the motion, the trial court said it considered all relevant factors in\nmitigation, including those mentioned by defendant, whether expressed or not. Although\ndefendant sought to raise new arguments at the motion hearing, the court specifically stated it\n\u201cdid consider all of the aggravating factors, [and] all of the mitigating factors.\u201d The court did not\nfind the mitigating factors \u201cvery strong in this case\u201d and said it \u201ccertainly felt and continue[s] to\nfeel that the aggravating factors in this case strongly outweigh the mitigating factors.\u201d Having\nconsidered all the factors raised by defendant postsentencing and finding the sentence within the\nstatutory range and appropriate under the circumstances, the court denied the motion to\nreconsider.\n\u00b6 22 This appeal followed.\n\u00b6 23 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 24 \u201cThe sentence imposed by the trial court is entitled to great deference and will not\nbe reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) People\nv. Wheeler, 2019 IL App (4th) 160937, \u00b6 39, 126 N.E.3d 787 (quoting People v. McGuire, 2017\nIL App (4th) 150695, \u00b6 38, 92 N.E.3d 494). \u201cWhen imposing a sentence, the trial court must\nconsider statutory factors in mitigation and aggravation, but the court need not recite and assign a\nvalue to each factor it has considered.\u201d McGuire, 2017 IL App (4th) 150695, \u00b6 38. \u201cThe weight\nto be accorded each factor in aggravation and mitigation in setting a sentence of imprisonment\ndepends on the circumstances of each case.\u201d People v. Hernandez, 204 Ill. App. 3d 732, 740, 562\nN.E.2d 219, 225 (1990). Citing Hernandez in People v. Crenshaw, 2011 IL App (4th) 090908,\n\u00b6 24, 959 N.E.2d 703, this court said, \u201c[t]he balance to be struck amongst the aggravating and\n- 8 -mitigating factors is a matter of judicial discretion that should not be disturbed absent an abuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d \u201cIn considering the propriety of a sentence, the reviewing court must proceed with\ngreat caution and must not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court merely because it\nwould have weighed the factors differently.\u201d People v. Fern, 189 Ill. 2d 48, 53, 723 N.E.2d 207,\n209 (1999). \u201cA sentence within statutory limits will not be deemed excessive and an abuse of the\ncourt\u2019s discretion unless it is \u2018greatly at variance with the spirit and purpose of the law or\nmanifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offense.\u2019 \u201d People v. Pina, 2019 IL App (4th)\n170614, \u00b6 20 (quoting Fern, 189 Ill. 2d at 54).\n\u00b6 25 Here, defendant contends the trial court considered improper factors in\naggravation and/or failed to consider relevant mitigating factors, and as a result, it abused its\ndiscretion by imposing an excessive sentence. In essence, this was the same argument raised in\nhis motion to reconsider the sentence. However, it is true a trial court is not to consider\nincompetent evidence, improper aggravating factors, or ignore pertinent mitigating factors when\nfashioning a sentence (see Hernandez, 204 Ill. App. 3d at 740). \u201cThe defendant bears the burden\nto affirmatively establish that the sentence was based on improper considerations, and we will\nnot reverse a sentence *** unless it is clearly evident the sentence was improper.\u201d People v.\nEtherton, 2017 IL App (5th) 140427, \u00b6 29, 82 N.E.3d 693.\n\u00b6 26 By selectively parsing some of the trial court\u2019s comments at sentencing while\nignoring others, defendant argues the court found no mitigating factors present, or it failed to\ntake them into consideration. The record reflects otherwise. While explaining its rationale for the\nsentence it was about to impose, the trial court first acknowledged it was required to consider\nprobation, then proceeded to discuss the other \u201cnumber of factors that I have to take into\nconsideration including the evidence that was received at trial, aggravating and mitigating factors\n- 9 -as set forth in the statute, other matters including the defendant\u2019s statement, the financial impact\nof a sentence and other relevant statutory factors.\u201d The court went on to say, \u201cwhen I look at the\naggravating and mitigating factors in the case, it does seem that the aggravating factors outweigh\nthe mitigating factors.\u201d The court then discussed the aggravating factor of defendant\u2019s prior\ncriminal history.\n\u00b6 27 Defendant contends the trial court \u201cimproperly rel[ied] on unverified criminal\nhistory records,\u201d arguing the court considered some of the unverified information regarding\noffenses from the seventies when fashioning its sentence. Actually, the court merely mentioned\nthem, noting defendant\u2019s prior record was \u201ca little confusing reading the report since some of the\nstuff has not been verified and/or confirmed.\u201d Taken in context, the comments about how far\nback the record goes were mentioned in relation to the confusing nature of the information. The\ncourt then switched gears, referencing a summary of actual convictions upon which it was\nrelying: \u201c[s]o there was a summary that was a little bit more helpful and that came\u2014Here we go.\nYou were sentenced in 1998 on some drug related offenses that you were paroled in 2003, and\nthen nothing between 2003 and 2013 if I understand your PSI correctly.\u201d The court then\nspecifically noted, \u201cand then there was some more arrests; and there are pending charges which\nthis court is not considering because you are presumed innocent.\u201d (Emphasis added).\n\u00b6 28 What defendant does not say, and which would not be clear from the transcript, is\nthat the presentence investigation report was structured in such a way as to list all known\nconvictions first, then separately identify those for which there was no verification beyond their\nlisting in the National Criminal Information Computer for this defendant. In spite of the lack of\nverification, defendant was familiar with at least 5 of the 13 offenses, indicating dispositions by\ndismissal, nolle prosequi, or a finding of not guilty. Defendant\u2019s argument disregards entirely the\n- 10 -State\u2019s perfectly reasonable observation that defendant, at the outset of the sentencing hearing,\ndenied he had \u201c[a]ny objection to the report that was tendered, or any information in there that\n[he] believe[d] was incorrect or needs to be clarified.\u201d There is nothing about the court\u2019s\ncomments which support defendant\u2019s claim. The court made no specific reference to any of the\n\u201cunverified\u201d offenses when providing its analysis of defendant\u2019s criminal history, and it is not\nreasonable to conclude it was unable to distinguish the unverified offenses from those known to\nbe defendant\u2019s.\n\u00b6 29 One comment by the trial court, \u201c[b]ut you do have a history of drug related\noffenses going back to your youth, and I understand that,\u201d is grasped upon by defendant as\njustification for his claim the court considered the unverified cases listed. Instead, elsewhere in\nthe report, defendant acknowledged his involvement with cannabis began \u201cin his 20\u2019s\u201d and\ncontinued to the present time. He acknowledged using cocaine since he was 25, and he continues\nto do so. Of the four Florida offenses between 1981 and 1993 listed as unverified, there is no\ncomment or notation by the report writer indicating defendant \u201cdid not recall\u201d them or denied the\nFlorida cases were his. In fact, he identified two of the four as having been either dismissed or\nresulting in a finding of no probable cause. A 1981 marijuana delivery/possession conviction out\nof Hillsborough County, Florida, resulted in a sentence of two years of probation. It, too, would\nhave taken place while defendant was in his twenties, and there is no notation indicating\ndefendant either denied or did not recall this case, so the court\u2019s comment must be taken in\ncontext.\n\u00b6 30 Defendant contends the trial court\u2019s comments that his history was a \u201cpretty\nstrong aggravating factor\u201d and, \u201cyou have continued to make bad choices throughout your entire\nlife,\u201d are to be interpreted by this court to \u201cshow reliance on the unverified records that\n- 11 -[defendant] did not remember, or believed were dismissed or not prosecuted.\u201d This amounts to\npure speculation by defendant since the record reveals the only offenses specifically referenced\nby the court were those convictions defendant does not contest. \u201c[T]he reviewing court should\nnot focus on a few words or statements of the trial court. Rather, the determination of whether or\nnot the sentence was improper must be made by considering the entire record as a whole.\u201d\nPeople v. Ward, 113 Ill. 2d 516, 526-27, 499 N.E.2d 422, 426 (1986).\n\u00b6 31 \u201cWhether a trial court considered an improper factor when sentencing a defendant\nis a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d People v. Winchester, 2016 IL App (4th)\n140781, \u00b6 72, 66 N.E.3d 601. \u201cThere is a strong presumption that the trial court based its\nsentencing determination on proper legal reasoning, and a court of review should consider the\nrecord as a whole, rather than focusing on a few words or statements by the trial court.\u201d People\nv. Canizalez-Cardena, 2012 IL App (4th) 110720, \u00b6 22, 979 N.E.2d 1014. It is the defendant\u2019s\nburden to \u201c \u2018affirmatively establish\u2019 \u201d the trial court relied on an improper sentencing factor\nwhen fashioning its sentence. People v. Williams, 2018 IL App (4th) 150759, \u00b6 18, 99 N.E.3d\n590.\n\u00b6 32 Even if defendant is able to meet his burden to show the trial court actually relied\nupon an improper factor in sentencing, remand is not required \u201cwhere it can be determined from\nthe record that the weight placed on the improperly considered aggravating factor was so\ninsignificant that it did not lead to a greater sentence ***.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\nPeople v. Gilliam, 172 Ill. 2d 484, 521, 670 N.E.2d 606, 623 (1996) (quoting People v. White,\n114 Ill. 2d 61, 67, 499 N.E.2d 467, 469 (1986), quoting People v. Bourke, 96 Ill. 2d 327, 332,\n449 N.E.2d 1338, 1340 (1983)).\n- 12 -\u00b6 33 Here, the trial court repeatedly noted it was to consider both factors in aggravation\nand mitigation, concluding the aggravating factors carried greater weight. Defendant, 65 years of\nage, was facing a Class 2 felony for growing 53 small and 58 large cannabis plants with a total\nweight of 4221 grams as part of an elaborate and expensive cannabis growing operation. He\nadmitted he was doing so, not only for personal pain management, but because it \u201cpays bills.\u201d\nAlthough he told the police this was his first time, he somehow knew he did not yet have a crop\nready for sale because it takes \u201cthree months cycles\u201d to get going.\n\u00b6 34 Defendant had a verified criminal history stretching back 34 years, or roughly half\nof his life, to 1983. He told the probation department he was using cannabis in his twenties. His\nfirst verified conviction was for controlled substances in 1983, and since that time, he had been\nconvicted of one criminal drug conspiracy in 1994, two possession of controlled substances cases\nin 1995, and one manufacture/delivery of controlled substances in 1996. This does not include an\nunrelated weapons offense out of Florida in 1992 and a previous cannabis possession in\nLivingston County in 2013. Having previously received a 15-year sentence, a 6-year sentence,\ntwo sentences of 18 months \u201cspecial\u201d probation, 2 years of probation, and 1 year conditional\ndischarge, defendant was not deterred from becoming involved in a large-scale cannabis\nproduction operation for which he was now facing the possibility of anywhere from 3 to 7 years\nin the penitentiary.\n\u00b6 35 Defendant had been asked to provide a urine screen prior to the beginning of his\nsentencing hearing and he refused. He told the probation department he had not consumed\ncocaine since \u201clast month\u201d and heroin \u201ca week ago\u201d when he appeared for his presentence\ninterview in June 2017. A drug screen conducted that day showed defendant tested positive for\nbenzodiazepine, heroin, methadone, morphine, and cocaine. He did not contest the results,\n- 13 -admitting buying methadone \u201coff the street\u201d and using \u201cnarcos,\u201d or narcotic drugs, without a\nvalid prescription.\n\u00b6 36 One would be hard-pressed not to consider defendant\u2019s criminal history\nsignificant, or his involvement with controlled substances long-standing. There is nothing in this\nrecord, absent defendant\u2019s bare speculation, to indicate the trial court improperly considered any\nunverified criminal history in fashioning its sentence.\n\u00b6 37 Next, defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion in noting the distinct\npossibility defendant was growing 111 cannabis plants, using sophisticated lighting connected to\ntimers, large carbon dioxide cannisters, and an elaborate ventilation system, all consistent with\nwhat the investigator described as an \u201cexpensive\u201d cannabis \u201cgrow\u201d operation or industry, for the\ncombined purposes of use and sale. Defendant argues since \u201cintent to sell\u201d was not charged, then\nit could not be considered. Of course, this completely ignores defendant\u2019s own admission to the\npolice, as reflected in the presentence investigation report, that he grew the cannabis both for his\npain management and because it \u201cpays bills,\u201d or defendant\u2019s admission he was growing the\ncannabis to make money, but that the grow cycle had not yet reached that point. It also fails to\nrecognize the trial court had defendant\u2019s criminal history before it, indicating prior convictions\nfor criminal drug conspiracy and manufacture/delivery of controlled substances, neither of which\nare considered simple possession offenses.\n\u00b6 38 Trial courts may discuss the extent and nature of a defendant\u2019s involvement in a\ncrime without being found to have relied on an improper factor in aggravation. In People v. Rios,\n2011 IL App (4th) 100461, 960 N.E.2d 70, the defendant contended the trial court improperly\nconsidered a factor in aggravation which was inherent in the offense by commenting on the\namount of money a defendant, convicted of possession with intent to deliver, was making a day,\n- 14 -the number of people being supplied, and the lack of financial need to sell drugs. We found\ncomments by the court intended to highlight the \u201cextent and nature of a defendant\u2019s involvement\nin a particular criminal enterprise, a defendant\u2019s underlying motivation for committing the\noffense, the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s commission of similar offenses in the future and the\nneed to deter others from committing similar crimes\u201d are proper considerations. Rios, 2011 IL\nApp (4th) 100461, \u00b6 15.\n\u00b6 39 Here defendant acknowledged his motivation for producing the plants was to \u201cpay\nbills,\u201d thereby clearly implying an intention to sell some of the cannabis he produced.\nConsidering the evidence of the quantity of plants and the \u201celaborate\u201d growing methods, when\ncoupled with defendant\u2019s own statements, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to consider\nthe very real possibility the production of such a quantity of cannabis plants was, at least in part,\nintended for sale. This does not constitute reliance upon an improper factor in aggravation but is\ninstead the observation of the court based upon both circumstantial and direct evidence. The trial\ncourt is permitted to consider the amount of drugs possessed, especially \u201cwithin the context of\ndetermining the seriousness of the offense, the need to protect the community, the need to deter\nothers from committing similar crimes, and to punish the defendant. These [are] all appropriate\nconsiderations for the court.\u201d People v. Garcia, 2018 IL App (4th) 170339, \u00b6 42, 99 N.E.3d 571.\nSuch was the context in which the comments were made. The court noted defendant\u2019s criminal\nhistory, history of drug related offenses and continued involvement with drugs, the seriousness\nof the offense, the need to deter others, and the protection of society\u2014all proper areas of\nconsideration at sentencing. See People v. McGath, 2017 IL App (4th) 150608, \u00b6 63, 83 N.E.3d\n671.\n- 15 -\u00b6 40 Defendant next contends the trial court abused its discretion by failing to consider\ndefendant\u2019s health, length of law-abiding behavior, and the nonviolent nature of the offense as\nfactors in mitigation. Considering the fact defendant appeared throughout this case, repeatedly\nreferenced his medical condition, requested continuances based on anticipated medical\nprocedures or treatments, sought a continuance of his sentencing because he was still \u201creceiving\ntreatments,\u201d maintained his cultivation of cannabis was to manage the pain caused by his\nmedical condition, and argued his medical condition as a reason he should receive probation, it is\ndifficult to envision a circumstance where a trial court could have been any more aware of a\ndefendant\u2019s medical condition.\n\u00b6 41 When offered an opportunity to make a recommendation to the trial court with\nregard to what his sentence should be, defendant began with: \u201c[w]ell, on the sentencing, Judge,\nyou know, I would like to get probation because, you know, I\u2019ve got medical reasons to. And I\nstill haven\u2019t finished my, you know, my therapies.\u201d During its pronouncement of sentence, the\ncourt noted: \u201cI understand you are talking about issues with regard to your medical condition;\nand that is, there is a mitigating factor that imprisonment would endanger your medical\ncondition. I don\u2019t see that as being a factor in this case. You\u2019ve had your surgery. You are doing,\nyou are engaged in therapy. There\u2019s nothing to suggest that your condition would worsen\nwhether that therapy was modified or adjusted or completed in the Department of Corrections if\nthat\u2019s the sentence.\u201d Defendant references this interchange between the court and defendant in\nhis brief. Defendant\u2019s argument, in reality, is not that the court failed to consider his medical\ncondition, but that the court did not assign the amount of weight to it defendant deems\nappropriate. It is clear mitigating evidence was before the court. When mitigating evidence is\n- 16 -before the court, it is assumed that the court considered it, unless the record indicates otherwise.\nPeople v. Burton, 184 Ill. 2d 1, 34, 703 N.E.2d 49, 65 (1998).\n\u00b6 42 Defendant further contends the trial court \u201cfailed to consider that [defendant] did\nnot cause physical harm, or contemplate that harm would be caused, to another person.\u201d As we\nnoted at the outset of this analysis, a sentencing court \u201cis not obligated to recite and assign value\nto each factor it relies upon, nor does it need to place greater weight on defendant\u2019s rehabilitative\npotential than on the seriousness of the offense or the need to protect the public.\u201d People v.\nMayoral, 299 Ill. App. 3d 899, 913, 702 N.E.2d 238, 248 (1998). The same is true here. Having\nindicated it has considered the statutory factors in aggravation and mitigation, we are to presume\nthe court considered the nonviolent nature of the offense; it just didn\u2019t give it much weight in the\noverall analysis, nor is it required to. People v. McCain, 248 Ill. App. 3d 844, 853-54, 617\nN.E.2d 1294, 1301-02 (1993).\n\u00b6 43 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 44 Having found the trial court properly considered the statutory factors in\naggravation and mitigation and imposed a sentence within the statutory range of sentences\npossible, we find there was no abuse of discretion and affirm the judgment and sentence of the\ncourt.\n\u00b6 45 Affirmed.\n- 17 -",

    "text": "United States Court of Appeals\nFor the Eighth Circuit\n___________________________\nNo. 18-3587\n___________________________\nRobert Ellingsworth\nlllllllllllllllllllllPlaintiff - Appellant\nv.\nVermeer Manufacturing Company\nlllllllllllllllllllllDefendant - Appellee\n____________\nAppeal from United States District Court\nfor the Western District of Missouri - Joplin\n____________\nSubmitted: December 10, 2019\nFiled: February 10, 2020\n____________\nBefore ERICKSON, ARNOLD, and KOBES, Circuit Judges.\n____________\nKOBES, Circuit Judge.\nRobert Ellingsworth sued Vermeer Manufacturing Company in Missouri state\ncourt, claiming he was injured while operating a Vermeer wood chipper. Vermeerremoved the case and the district court1 denied Ellingsworth\u2019s motions to remand and\nfor leave to amend and granted summary judgment to Vermeer. We affirm each of\nthose rulings.\nI.\nEllingsworth, an employee of Vaught Tree Service, was injured on the job in\nFebruary 2014. He was feeding a small tree into a Vermeer-manufactured wood\nchipper using a winch attached to the chipper when the winch line became entangled\nin the tree\u2019s branches. The line was drawn into the chipper and then shot back out,\nseriously injuring Ellingsworth\u2019s legs.\nEllingsworth filed this action in Missouri state court. As relevant here, he\nalleged products liability and failure to warn claims under both strict liability and\nnegligence theories. He also brought claims against his supervisor at Vaught,\nDwayne Marshall, alleging Marshall increased the danger posed by the wood chipper\non the job site.\nVermeer, an Iowa citizen, removed the case to federal court asserting diversity\njurisdiction. Ellingsworth, a Missouri citizen, moved to remand, arguing there was\nno complete diversity because Marshall was also a Missouri citizen. The district\ncourt denied the motion, finding that Marshall was fraudulently joined because\nEllingsworth had no cause of action against him. Shortly after, Ellingsworth\nvoluntarily dismissed Marshall from the case.\n1 The Honorable Sarah W. Hays, United States Magistrate Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri, to whom the case was referred for final disposition by\nconsent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).\n-2-Discovery revealed that although Vermeer manufactured the wood chipper, the\nwinch was an after-market component constructed of mostly Vermeer parts and added\nby an unknown prior owner. Based on several parts invoices turned up in discovery,\nEllingsworth believed that the winch had been constructed by Vermeer Sales of\nOklahoma, a Vermeer dealership.2 Ellingsworth amended his complaint to add\nVermeer Oklahoma as a defendant. However, Vermeer Oklahoma was defunct and\nnever answered the complaint. Ellingsworth voluntarily dismissed it from the case\nafter he determined it was essentially unreachable.\nWith no way to bring Vermeer Oklahoma into the case, Ellingsworth moved\nto amend his complaint to add a claim for agency liability against Vermeer to hold it\nliable for the actions of its dealer. The district court denied that motion because the\ntime to amend the complaint under the scheduling order had passed and Ellingsworth\ncould not show \u201cgood cause\u201d for the delay.\nThe district court granted summary judgment to Vermeer on all counts and\nEllingsworth appealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\nII.\nEllingsworth challenges the denial of his motion to remand and suggests that\nwe should vacate all of the district court\u2019s subsequent rulings and send this case back\nto state court.\n\u201c[A] district court\u2019s error in failing to remand a case improperly removed is not\nfatal to the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the\ntime judgment is entered.\u201d Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 U.S. 61, 64 (1996). Here,\n2 If true, Vermeer Oklahoma violated its dealer agreement, which prohibited\nit from modifying Vermeer products or manufacturing parts.\n-3-after the district court denied the motion to remand, Ellingsworth voluntarily\ndismissed the only nondiverse party (Marshall) then in the case. When judgment was\nentered, there was complete diversity among the parties. Even assuming the district\ncourt erred, under Caterpillar Ellingsworth cannot get the relief he wants.\nTo avoid this conclusion, Ellingsworth attempts to confine Caterpillar to cases\nin which federal proceedings have carried on for an unusually long time or\nculminated in a jury trial. But we have held that \u201cCaterpillar suggests a categorical\nrule, not a case-by-case inquiry into how much time was spent litigating each\nparticular case in the district court,\u201d Buffets, Inc. v. Leischow, 732 F.3d 889, 898 (8th\nCir. 2013), and we have found it applicable to summary judgment, see Junk v.\nTerminix Int\u2019l Co., 628 F.3d 439, 447 (8th Cir. 2010).\nIII.\nEllingsworth next argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion\nfor leave to amend his complaint to add a claim of agency liability against Vermeer.\nWe review that decision for an abuse of discretion. Harris v. FedEx Nat\u2019l LTL, Inc.,\n760 F.3d 780, 786 (8th Cir. 2014).\nBecause Ellingsworth sought to amend his complaint after the deadline had\npassed, he must show \u201cgood cause.\u201d Sherman v. Winco Fireworks, Inc., 532 F.3d\n709, 716 (8th Cir. 2008); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b). \u201cThe primary measure of\ngood cause is the movant\u2019s diligence in attempting to meet deadlines.\u201d Albright v.\nMountain Home Sch. Dist., 926 F.3d 942, 951 (8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).\nGood cause may be shown by pointing to a change in the law, newly discovered facts,\nor another significant changed circumstance that requires amendment of a party\u2019s\npleading. Hartis v. Chi. Title Ins. Co., 694 F.3d 935, 948 (8th Cir. 2012).\n-4-As the district court explained in denying his motion, at the time that\nEllingsworth sought leave to amend, no new facts supporting an agency liability\nclaim against Vermeer had come to light. On top of that, the litigation was at an\nadvanced stage and granting the motion would have required reopening discovery.\nEllingsworth admits that his real reason for pressing the agency claim belatedly was\nhis realization that he had no other way to hold Vermeer Oklahoma liable for\nallegedly building and installing the winch. His attempted addition of the claim had\nmore to do with a change in litigation strategy than in the factual or legal basis of his\ncase. That is not sufficient to establish good cause and the district court was well\nwithin its discretion to deny the motion.\nIV.\nFinally, Ellingsworth claims that the district court erred in granting Vermeer\u2019s\nmotion for summary judgment on his products liability and failure to warn claims.\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if the record shows\nthat there are no genuine issues of material fact and the prevailing party is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law. Junk, 628 F.3d at 450.\nOn appeal, Ellingsworth makes clear that his remaining claims against Vermeer\nfor both products liability and failure to warn only concern the winch attachment to\nthe wood chipper, not the wood chipper itself. Under Missouri law, both strict\nliability and negligence versions of these claims require that the defendant\nmanufactured or sold the product causing injury. Johnson v. Auto Handling Corp.,\n523 S.W.3d 452, 466 (Mo. banc 2017) (negligent products liability and failure to\nwarn); Moore v. Ford Motor Co., 332 S.W.3d 749, 756 (Mo. banc 2011) (strict\nliability failure to warn); Strong v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 261 S.W.3d 493, 506 (Mo. Ct.\nApp. 2007), overruled on other grounds by Badahman v. Catering St. Louis, 395\nS.W.3d 29, 40 (Mo. banc 2013) (strict liability products liability). That element is\nfatal to Ellingsworth\u2019s case.\n-5-The record shows that Vermeer did not manufacture the winch attachment that\ninjured Ellingsworth. It is uncontested that Vermeer offers no after-market winch\nattachments for sale and that the wood chipper that injured Ellingsworth did not have\na winch when Vermeer manufactured it. At most, the evidence suggests that the\nwinch was constructed by a third party out of mostly Vermeer parts, but\nEllingsworth\u2019s suit is not about the quality of the winch parts. He alleges that\nVermeer manufactured the winch itself. Because the record forecloses that argument,\nthe district court correctly granted Vermeer summary judgment. We affirm.\n______________________________\n-6-",

Civil Action No. 1-19-cv-00200)\nDistrict Judge: Honorable John E. Jones, III\n____________________________________\nSubmitted for Possible Summary Action\nPursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6\nNovember 26, 2019\nBefore: MCKEE, SHWARTZ and PHIPPS, Circuit Judges\n(Opinion filed: February 10, 2020)\n_________\nOPINION*\n_________\nPER CURIAM\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.Lionel Holloway appeals from an order of the District Court denying his petition\nfor writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. For the reasons that follow, we will\nsummarily affirm.\nIn 2009, Holloway pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of\nMaryland to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, having been designated\nas an armed career criminal based on three previous felony convictions for serious drug\noffenses. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed on direct\nappeal. United States v. Holloway, 431 F. App\u2019x 233 (4th Cir. 2011). Holloway\nsubsequently filed two 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motions, arguing that he no longer qualified as\nan armed career criminal in light of Johnson v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), and\nthat he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Both \u00a7 2255 motions were denied;\nthe first as untimely and the second as an unauthorized successive motion that was\nnonetheless meritless. The Fourth Circuit also denied his application for authorization to\nfile a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.\nOn February 5, 2019, Holloway filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus under\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of\nPennsylvania, again challenging his designation as an armed career criminal at\nsentencing, and claiming he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In response\nto a question on the petition form as to why a remedy under \u00a7 2255 was inadequate or\nineffective, Holloway wrote: \u201cDue to the nature of the argument; [sic] a motion pursuant\nto Section 2241 is a more appropriate vehicle.\u201d On June 26, 2019, the District Court\n2dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction because Holloway had failed to\nshow that relief under \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective.1\nHolloway appeals. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.2 Our Clerk\nadvised the parties that we might act summarily to dispose of the appeal under Third Cir.\nL.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.\nWe will summarily affirm the order of the District Court because no substantial\nquestion is presented by this appeal, Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6. \u201cMotions\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can\nchallenge their convictions or sentences[.]\u201d Okereke v. United States, 307 F.3d 117, 120\n(3d Cir. 2002). Section 2255(e) of title 28, also known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides,\nhowever, that an application for a writ of habeas corpus may proceed if \u201cit . . . appears\nthat the remedy by [\u00a7 2255] motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [a\nprisoner\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). \u201cSection 2255 is not inadequate or\nineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute\nof limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping\nrequirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.\u201d Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, 290 F.3d\n1 On August 2, 2019, Holloway filed another \u00a7 2255 motion in the District of Maryland,\nagain challenging his designation at sentencing as an armed career criminal in light of\nSupreme Court caselaw, and briefing was ordered.\n2 A certificate of appealability is not required to appeal from the denial of a \u00a7 2241\npetition. See Burkey v. Marberry, 556 F.3d 142, 146 (3d Cir. 2009).\n3536, 539 (3d Cir. 2002) (per curiam). \u201cIt is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal\ninability to utilize it, that is determinative.\u201d Id. at 538.\nWhen a federal prisoner attacks the validity of his conviction, he may proceed\nunder \u00a7 2241 only if (1) he asserts a colorable claim of actual innocence on the theory\nthat \u201che is being detained for conduct that has subsequently been rendered non-criminal\nby an intervening Supreme Court decision,\u201d and (2) he is \u201cotherwise barred from\nchallenging the legality of the conviction under \u00a7 2255.\u201d Cordaro v. United States, 933\nF.3d 232, 239 (3d Cir. 2019) (quoting Bruce v. Warden Lewisburg USP, 868 F.3d 170,\n180 (3d Cir. 2017)).\nHolloway may not resort to the \u00a7 2241 remedy. He raises a claim that can be\nbrought in a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, provided that he meets the\nrequirements under \u00a7 2255(h) for doing so.3 The fact that the Fourth Circuit denied\nHolloway\u2019s request to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not mean that \u00a7 2255 is\ninadequate or ineffective. See Cradle, 290 F.3d at 539. Accordingly, the District Court\nlacked jurisdiction over Holloway\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition and properly dismissed the petition.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court\ndismissing Holloway\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.\n3 Indeed, Holloway has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court and briefing has\nbeen ordered.\n4",

The State has moved to affirm\nthe judgment below on the ground that it is manifest on the face of Brown\u2019s opening\nbrief that his appeal is without merit. We agree and affirm.\n(2) In September 2013, a Superior Court jury found Brown guilty of\npossession of marijuana, drug dealing, aggravated possession of a controlledsubstance, carrying a concealed deadly weapon, possession of a deadly weapon\nduring the commission of a felony, second degree conspiracy, and second degree\ncriminal solicitation. The Superior Court deferred sentencing, pending a presentence\ninvestigation. Prior to sentencing, the State filed a motion to have Brown declared\nan habitual offender under 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(b) (\u201c\u00a7 4214(b)\u201d). On October 29, 2013,\nthe Superior Court granted the State\u2019s motion and sentenced Brown as follows: (i)\nas an habitual offender under \u00a7 4214(b) to two life sentences for the charges of drug\ndealing and aggravated possession; (ii) as an habitual offender under 11 Del. C.\n\u00a7 4214(a) (\u201c\u00a7 4214(a)\u201d) to twenty-seven years of Level V incarceration for the\nweapons offenses; (iii) to two years of Level V incarceration, suspended for one year\nof Level II probation for second degree conspiracy; and (iv) to six months of Level\nV incarceration, suspended for one year of Level II probation for possession of\nmarijuana.1 On December 16, 2014, the Superior Court corrected the sentencing\norder to reflect the fact that the drug dealing and aggravated possession offenses\nmerged for sentencing purposes. This Court affirmed Brown\u2019s convictions and\nsentence on direct appeal.2\n(3) On October 2, 2019, Brown filed a motion for correction of sentence.\nBrown argued that (i) his sentence under \u00a7 4214(b) was improper because he should\n1 At sentencing, the Superior Court merged the criminal solicitation and conspiracy offenses.\n2 Brown v. State, 117 A.3d 568 (Del. 2015).\n2have been sentenced under \u00a7 4214(a) and (ii) his life sentence as a \u201cnon-king-pin\ndrug dealer\u201d constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The Superior Court denied\nthe motion on the basis that Brown\u2019s sentence was appropriate for all the reasons\nstated at the time of sentencing and no additional information had been provided to\nthe court that would warrant a reduction or modification of the sentence. This appeal\nfollowed.\n(4) On appeal, Brown argues that (i) the Superior Court was required to\nsentence him in accordance with \u00a7 4214(a) because he admitted he was eligible\nunder \u00a7 4214(a) in 2006 when he pleaded guilty to possession with intent to\ndistribute cocaine in a different criminal case; (ii) the Superior Court erred by not\nconducting a separate hearing to determine the existence of three prior predicate\nfelony convictions; and (iii) his sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.\nBrown\u2019s arguments are unavailing.\n(5) We review the denial of a motion for correction of sentence for abuse\nof discretion.3 To the extent a claim involves a question of law, we review the claim\nde novo.4 A sentence is illegal if it exceeds statutory limits, violates double jeopardy,\nis ambiguous with respect to the time and manner in which it is to be served, is\n3 Fountain v. State, 2014 WL 4102069, at *1 (Del. Aug. 19, 2014).\n4 Id.\n3internally contradictory, omits a term required to be imposed by statute, is uncertain\nas to its substance, or is a sentence that the judgment of conviction did not authorize.5\n(6) Although it appears that the Superior Court mistakenly treated Brown\u2019s\nmotion as a motion for modification of sentence filed under Rule 35(b), rather than\na motion for correction of sentence under Rule 35(a), we nonetheless affirm the\nSuperior Court\u2019s denial of Brown\u2019s motion on the independent and alternative\nground that it lacked merit under Rule 35(a).6\n(7) In a prior unrelated case, Brown pleaded guilty to possession with intent\nto deliver cocaine in March 2006. As part of the plea agreement, (i) the State nolle\nprosequied the remaining nine charges against Brown, (ii) the parties asked for\nimmediate sentencing, (iii) the parties requested that the minimum mandatory\nsentence of three years of Level V incarceration be imposed, and (iv) Brown\nadmitted that he was an habitual offender as defined by \u00a7 4214(a). The Superior\nCourt accepted the plea and sentenced Brown to three years of Level V incarceration.\nThe sentencing order notes that Brown admits he is an habitual offender under\n\u00a7 4214(a). Brown did not appeal his conviction or sentence. Brown now argues that\nthe court was obligated to sentence him as an habitual offender under \u00a7 4214(a) in\n5 Brittingham v. State, 705 A.2d 577, 578 (Del. 1998).\n6 See Unitrin, Inc. v. American Gen. Corp., 651 A.2d 1361, 1390 (Del. 1995) (noting that the\nDelaware Supreme Court may affirm a trial court\u2019s judgment for reasons different than those\narticulated by the trial court).\n42013. Brown is incorrect. Brown, by admitting he was an habitual offender under\n\u00a7 4214(a), arguably relieved the State of its burden of proof to have him declared an\nhabitual offender under that subsection for any future felony conviction. But the\nState elected to initiate the habitual offender status process under \u00a7 4214(b)\nfollowing Brown\u2019s 2013 jury trial. Accordingly, the State filed with the court its\nmotion to declare Brown an habitual offender\u2014as required by 11 Del. C.\n\u00a7 4215(b)\u2014together with documentary evidence in the form of certified court\nrecords of Brown\u2019s prior predicate convictions.7 Brown\u2019s 2013 conviction for drug\ndealing was an enumerated triggering felony in the version of \u00a7 4214(b) in effect at\nthe time.8 Once the State met its burden and established beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat Brown had been convicted of two enumerated predicate felonies under\n\u00a7 4214(b), the court was bound to sentence him to life under that subsection.9\n(8) Brown next argues that he was entitled to a separate hearing to establish\nthe existence of his predicate felonies. Because Brown did not raise this argument\n7 See Hall v. State, 788 A.2d 118, 128 (Del. 2001) (\u201cWe hold that the State need offer only\nunambiguous documentary evidence of a prior predicate conviction, not live witnesses, and not a\nparticular or exclusive type of documentary evidence. Once the State has offered evidence of the\nprior conviction that is regular on its face, the State has met its burden of establishing a prima facie\ncase.\u201d).\n8 Brown\u2019s conviction for aggravated possession was also an enumerated triggering felony under\n\u00a7 4214(b) but, as previously noted, that offense merged with Brown\u2019s drug dealing offense. See\nAyers v. State, 97 A.3d 1037, 1041 (Del. 2014).\n9 Reeder v. State, 2001 WL 355732, at *3 (Mar. 26, 2001) (\u201cSimply put, the General Assembly, in\nenacting \u00a7 4214, limited the Superior Court\u2019s sentencing discretion once the State properly initiates\nthe habitual offender status process.\u201d).\n5below, we will not ordinarily entertain it on appeal.10 In any event, Brown\u2019s\ncontention is unavailing. Although it is unclear whether he believes the court should\nhave held a separate hearing in 2006 or 2013, it is clear that Brown has long since\nwaived any challenge he could have raised with respect to his completed 2006\nsentence. As for Brown\u2019s 2013 sentence, Brown raised no objection to the Superior\nCourt sentencing him on the same day it considered the State\u2019s habitual offender\nmotion, nor did he file a timely motion for the correction of a sentence imposed in\nan illegal manner within ninety days of the imposition of the sentence.11\nAccordingly, Brown may not object to court\u2019s failure to hold a separate hearing on\nthe State\u2019s motion to declare him an habitual offender now.\n(9) Finally, Brown contends that his sentence is an unconstitutionally\ndisproportionate sentence in violation of the prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment contained in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nThere is no dispute that Brown was eligible to be sentenced as an habitual offender.\nAt the sentencing hearing, Brown\u2019s counsel acknowledged, and the Superior Court\n10 Del. Supr. Ct. R. 8 (\u201cOnly questions fairly presented to the trial court may be presented for\nreview; provided, however, that when the interests of justice so require, the Court may consider\nand determine any question not so presented.\u201d); Delaware Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Duphily, 703 A.2d\n1202, 1206 (Del. 1997) (\u201cIt is a basic tenet of appellate practice that an appellate court reviews\nonly matters considered in the first instance by a trial court. Parties are not free to advance\narguments for the first time on appeal.\u201d).\n11 See Walley v. State, 2007 WL 135615, at *1 (Del. Jan. 11, 2007) (holding that a challenge to the\ntiming of the habitual offender status hearing was, in fact, a motion for the correction of a sentence\nimposed in an illegal manner that was required to be filed within ninety days of sentencing under\nRule 35).\n6found on the basis of the record before it, that Brown had four separate prior felony\nconvictions, two of which were enumerated predicate felonies under the version of\n\u00a7 4214(b) then in effect. Because Brown was convicted of drug dealing, the Superior\nCourt was required under that version of the habitual offender statute\u2014a version we\nrepeatedly upheld as constitutional\u2014to sentence Brown to a life term.12 Likewise,\nthe court was obligated to sentence Brown under \u00a7 4214(a) on the felony weapons\noffenses. In short, Brown\u2019s sentence is not illegal.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the judgment of the Superior\nCourt is AFFIRMED.\nBY THE COURT:\n/s/ Collins J. Seitz, Jr.\nChief Justice\n12 In 2013, 11 Del. C. \u00a7 4214(b) provided, \u201cAny person who has been 2 times convicted of a felony\nor an attempt to commit a felony hereinafter specifically named\u2026 and who shall thereafter be\nconvicted of a subsequent felony hereinafter specifically named\u2026 is declared to be an habitual\ncriminal, and the court in which such third or subsequent conviction is had, in imposing sentence,\nshall impose a life sentence upon the person so convicted\u2026.\u201d The enumerated felonies included\n(i) Brown\u2019s prior predicate felonies of delivery of a narcotic Schedule II controlled substance and\npossession with intent to distribute a narcotic Schedule II controlled substance; and (ii) Brown\u2019s\ntriggering felony of drug dealing.\n7",

LOCKETT, ) Honorable\n) Philip B. Alfeld,\nDefendant-Appellant. ) Judge, presiding.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nJUSTICE OVERSTREET delivered the judgment of the court.\nPresiding Justice Welch and Justice Barberis concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: Defendant failed to provide evidence establishing that the circuit court did\nnot review her evidence, and the ruling of the circuit court was not against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\u00b6 2 The defendant, Reba M. Lockett, appeals pro se the circuit court\u2019s judgment for the\nplaintiff, Darwyn\u2019s Plumbing, in the amount of $6203 plus court costs and against her\ncounterclaim. She argues that the evidence did not support the judgment for the plaintiff and that\nthe court failed to review all of the documents supporting her counterclaim. For the following\nreasons, we affirm.\n1\u00b6 3 BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 The defendant hired the plaintiff to repair a sewer line breakage in her basement. The\nservices included jackhammering the concrete floor, replacing the sewer line from inside to outside\nthe home, cleaning a contaminated area on the basement floor, removing part of a wall, hand-\ndigging, back-filling, and removing soil, as well as reconcreting the floor back to level. The work\norder signed by the defendant states, \u201cPrice includes cleanouts. Darwyns plumbing not responsible\nfor any landscaping, dirt removed added or settling,\u201d with a total price of $9203.\n\u00b6 5 Because of nonpayment, the plaintiff filed a small claims case in the amount of $9203\nagainst the defendant for plumbing services. The defendant filed her response and countersuit for\ndamages in the amount of $10,000. The defendant alleged that plaintiff billed her for services that\nwere not performed and caused damage to her property. The defendant attached additional\nestimates to support her countersuit against the plaintiff.\n\u00b6 6 After a trial in which both parties testified, the court found in favor of the plaintiff in the\namount of $6203 and court costs in the amount of $192, and against the defendant in her\ncountersuit. The defendant appeals.\n\u00b6 7 ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 8 We begin by noting that the record does not contain a report of proceedings from that trial.\nIt is the appellant\u2019s duty to provide a complete record on appeal, including transcripts of the\nrelevant proceedings or, if no verbatim transcript is available, a bystander\u2019s report or an agreed\nstatement of facts. Ill. S. Ct. R. 321 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); R. 323 (eff. July 1, 2017). \u201cAny doubts\narising from the incompleteness of a record will be resolved against the appellant. (See Daniels v.\nCity of Venice (1987), 162 Ill. App. 3d 788, 791.)\u201d Hanson v. Illinois Central Gulf R.R. Co., 174\nIll. App. 3d 723, 725 (1988).\n2\u00b6 9 Although the defendant frames her argument on appeal as the circuit court\u2019s failure to\nconsider all of the documentary evidence she provided, the essence of her argument is that the\nevidence does not support a judgment for the plaintiff on his complaint or against her on her\ncounterclaim. Whether a party has breached a contract is a question of fact. Israel v. National\nCanada Corp., 276 Ill. App. 3d 454, 461 (1995). We will defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings\nand will not reverse the court\u2019s decision unless those findings are against the manifest weight of\nthe evidence. In re Tiffany M., 353 Ill. App. 3d 883, 890 (2004). \u201cA factual finding is against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident or if the\ndetermination is arbitrary, unreasonable, and not based on the evidence. Tiffany M., 353 Ill. App.\n3d at 890.\u201d In re G.W., 357 Ill. App. 3d 1058, 1059 (2005).\n\u00b6 10 In addition to the plaintiff\u2019s plumbing estimate and work order, the record includes two\ngroups of exhibits provided by the defendant. The documents include a check from Cross Country\n(the defendant\u2019s home warranty provider) for $3580 to Darwyn\u2019s Plumbing, an invoice for the\nwork completed, a bill for the original visit, and charges for work that the defendant felt the\nplaintiff did not perform, as well as expenses for alleged damages to her property. Additionally,\nshe included several email and text exchanges between the parties related to her complaints about\nthe plaintiff\u2019s work and the damage done to her property.\n\u00b6 11 According to the defendant\u2019s exhibits, the plaintiff was at her property between September\n19 and 24, 2016, and performed \u201cwork\u201d there. The October 4, 2016, work order signed by the\ndefendant states, \u201cPrice includes cleanouts. Darwyns plumbing not responsible for any\nlandscaping, dirt removed added or settling,\u201d with a total price of $9203. The email/text message\nexchanges do not show any \u201cissue\u201d with the quality of \u201cwork\u201d until October 19, 2016, when the\nplaintiff brought the bill to her house. Based on the defendant\u2019s own exhibits and the other\n3evidence in the record, and in light of the defendant\u2019s failure to provide a transcript, bystander\u2019s\nreport, or an agreed statement of facts, we cannot say that the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff\nperformed work on her property and \u201cexcepted\u201d any damage to landscaping, etc., was against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence.\n\u00b6 12 CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 13 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Madison County is affirmed.\n\u00b6 14 Affirmed.\n4",

He has also filed two motions for a stay of the district\ncourt\u2019s judgment pending the disposition of the petitions. We conclude that Hill is not\nentitled to relief.\nMandamus relief is a drastic remedy and should be used only in extraordinary\ncircumstances. Kerr v. U.S. Dist. Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402 (1976); United States v.\nMoussaoui, 333 F.3d 509, 516-17 (4th Cir. 2003). Further, mandamus relief is available\nonly when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief sought. In re Braxton, 258 F.3d 250,\n261 (4th Cir. 2001). Mandamus may not be used as a substitute for appeal. In re Lockheed\nMartin Corp., 503 F.3d 351, 353 (4th Cir. 2007).\nSimilarly, a writ of prohibition \u201cis a drastic and extraordinary remedy which should\nbe granted only when the petitioner has shown his right to the writ to be clear and\nundisputable and that the actions of the court were a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d In re\nVargas, 723 F.2d 1461, 1468 (10th Cir. 1983). A writ of prohibition also may not be used\nas a substitute for appeal. Id.\nHill can seek the requested relief in an appeal of the district court\u2019s judgment, and\nindeed, such an appeal is currently pending before this court. See United States v.

Goodface is serving two concurrent sentences: a 28-month\nfederal term of imprisonment for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and\nthe remainder of a five-year state parole revocation sentence. He filed a pro se\nhabeas application pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, seeking an award of presentence\n* After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral\nargument.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent,\nexcept under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It\nmay be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1\nand 10th Cir. R. 32.1.confinement credit against his federal sentence. After appointing counsel and\nreceiving briefing from the parties, the district court denied his application.\nGoodface timely appealed. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we\naffirm.\nI\nGoodface was convicted in Colorado state court of attempted first-degree\nmurder and sentenced to a twenty-year prison term, to be followed by a mandatory\nfive-year term of parole. On March 22, 2016, he was released from prison and began\nserving his state parole term. On June 24, 2016, he was arrested for violating his\nparole conditions. He was held in county jail and charged with state offenses. On\nAugust 24, 2016, he was indicted on a federal charge of possession of a firearm by a\nprohibited person. The state offenses, which were based on the same conduct as the\nfederal charge, were later dismissed.\nOn August 30, 2016, Goodface was transferred to the custody of the United\nStates Marshals Service (\u201cUSMS\u201d) pursuant to a federal writ of habeas corpus ad\nprosequendum. He remained in the physical custody of USMS from August 30, 2016\nto February 21, 2018.\nGoodface pled guilty in federal court to the firearms charge. On February 22,\n2018, he was sentenced to a 28-month federal term of imprisonment and began\nserving his federal sentence that day. His judgment and sentence recommended that\nhe be given credit for time served. Although the judgment was silent concerning\nwhether the federal sentence was to be served concurrently or consecutively to the\n2remaining state sentence, the federal sentencing judge later retroactively designated\nthe sentence to run concurrently with his state sentence.\nOn March 28, 2018, the Colorado State Board of Parole revoked Goodface\u2019s\nstate parole sentence. The Colorado Department of Corrections (\u201cCDOC\u201d) granted\nhim credit against his parole sentence for the entire period he was \u201con the streets\u201d\nfrom March 22, 2016 (when he was released from prison) to March 28, 2018 (when\nhis parole was revoked). But Goodface also sought presentence confinement credit\nagainst his federal sentence for the time period when he was in USMS custody prior\nto receiving his federal sentence, from August 30, 2016 to February 21, 2018. After\nthe federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) denied him that requested credit, he filed this\npetition.1\nII\nIn computing a federal sentence, we follow a two-step process: we first\ndetermine the commencement date of the federal sentence, then address whether the\ndefendant can receive credit for time spent in custody prior to the commencement of\nthat sentence. Binford v. United States, 436 F.3d 1252, 1254 (10th Cir. 2006). The\ndistrict court concluded the BOP correctly determined that Goodface began serving\nhis federal sentence on February 22, 2018. It denied his habeas application because it\nconcluded he had already received credit on his state sentence for the entire period\n1 A federal district court lacks authority to grant credits against federal\nsentences. Such authority lies exclusively with the BOP, the decisions of which are\nsubject to administrative and judicial review. See United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S.\n329, 335 (1992).\n3from June 24, 2016 to February 22, 2018 and was thus ineligible for credit against his\nfederal sentence.\nThis appeal presents a pure legal issue of statutory interpretation, which we\nreview de novo. See Wright v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 451 F.3d 1231, 1233 (10th\nCir. 2006). \u201cOur task is to interpret the words of the statute in light of the purposes\nCongress sought to serve.\u201d Id. at 1234 (quotation omitted). Our inquiry begins with\nthe statutory language, and we read its words \u201cin their context and with a view to\ntheir place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted).\nUnder 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b), a defendant is entitled to \u201ccredit toward the\nservice of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior\nto the date the sentence commences,\u201d but only if that time \u201chas not been credited\nagainst another sentence.\u201d In enacting \u00a7 3585(b), \u201cCongress made clear that a\ndefendant could not receive a double credit for his detention time.\u201d Wilson, 503 U.S.\nat 337.\nGoodface argues the credit he received against his Colorado sentence was for\ntime Colorado considered him to be \u201con the streets,\u201d which he would have received\nfor being on parole regardless of whether he served that time in BOP custody.2 The\ncredit the CDOC granted him, he contends, was therefore not due to his being in\nofficial detention and should not count as a credit against his state sentence for\npurposes of \u00a7 3585(b). He argues the word \u201ccredited\u201d used in \u00a7 3585(b), taken in\n2 Respondents do not contest this interpretation of Colorado law.\n4context, unambiguously refers to time credited against another sentence because of\nofficial detention, and only for that reason. Alternatively, if \u00a7 3585(b) is ambiguous,\nGoodface contends we should look to the purpose of the provision, which is to ensure\nthat defendants do not receive duplicative credit due to time spent in official\ndetention.\nWe agree with the district court that Goodface is not entitled to further credit\nagainst his federal sentence. He has already received credit toward his state sentence\nfor time spent in official detention from August 30, 2016 to February 21, 2018, prior\nto the commencement of his federal sentence on February 22, 2018. The fact that\nColorado would have afforded him the same credit for serving a term of parole in the\ncommunity is irrelevant. The time Goodface spent in official detention was credited\nagainst his state sentence. That is all the statute\u2019s plain language requires.\nGoodface also notes that \u00a7 3585(b) makes no reference to credit granted\ntoward a term of parole. But under Colorado law, \u201cthe term \u2018sentence\u2019 incorporates\nboth the incarceration component and the mandatory parole component of an\noffender\u2019s penalty.\u201d People v. Norton, 63 P.3d 339, 344 (Colo. 2003). Goodface\ndoes not contest this principle of Colorado law.\nAlthough \u00a7 3585(b) does refer to credit for time spent in official detention,\nnothing in the statute requires the BOP to ignore a state\u2019s grant of credit against a\nparole sentence. The statute does not require a court to inquire into why the credit\nwas given, or under what other circumstances such credit might have been given.\nThis interpretation is consistent with the statutory purpose of the exclusion, which is\n5to prevent a defendant from receiving \u201ca double credit for his detention time.\u201d\nWilson, 503 U.S. at 337. In this case, the BOP did just that: consistent with\n\u00a7 3585(b), it denied Goodface credit against his federal sentence for the time he spent\nin USMS custody because Colorado had already credited that time against his state\nparole sentence.\nIII\nAFFIRMED.

Tollefson, Deputy Attorney\nGeneral, Boise, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nLORELLO, Judge\nDavid J. Whitecotton appeals from his judgment of conviction for unlawful possession of\na firearm. Whitecotton argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress\nand that the district court abused its discretion at sentencing. We affirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOne afternoon, a citizen observed a man pacing outside a local pharmacy. After entering\nthe pharmacy to fill a prescription, the citizen watched the man enter and inquire about maps.\nThe citizen then left the pharmacy to meet a family member at the neighboring supermarket.\nUpon leaving the supermarket, the citizen and her brother struck up a conversation with some\nfriends they encountered in the parking lot. The man then approached the group and injected\n1himself into their conversation and introduced himself as Whitecotton. Whitecotton then\nlingered with the group and kept turning his body toward them to display his holstered firearm.\nAfter a few minutes, the conversation ended and the citizen left. The citizen found\nWhitecotton\u2019s behavior so strange and suspicious that she went to the police department with her\nbrother and reported him.\nIn response to the citizen\u2019s report, an officer was dispatched to the pharmacy. The officer\nobserved a vehicle with Oregon license plates matching the one reportedly associated with\nWhitecotton. The officer parked his patrol vehicle in a parking spot several feet away and\napproached Whitecotton\u2019s vehicle on foot. The officer made contact with Whitecotton, who was\nsitting in the driver\u2019s seat of the vehicle, and began a conversation with him. The officer told\nWhitecotton that \u201csomebody called and said [he] was acting really weird.\u201d As the officer told\nWhitecotton about the call, Whitecotton started his vehicle and said something in response,\nwhich was inaudible over the vehicle\u2019s engine noise. The officer responded: \u201cWhat was that?\nTalk to me for a minute. Turn that off.\u201d Whitecotton complied. During the ensuing\nconversation, the officer asked Whitecotton about the kind of gun he had and why he had been in\nthe store. Whitecotton said he was buying a football for a kid. The officer then asked\nWhitecotton for his driver\u2019s license. When Whitecotton responded by asking the officer whether\nhe had \u201ccause for this,\u201d the officer explained that he would get out of Whitecotton\u2019s \u201chair in a\nminute,\u201d but the officer wanted to know who he was talking to. Whitecotton could not produce a\ndriver\u2019s license, but eventually provided an identification card. When asked where he lived,\nWhitecotton stated that he lived in Oregon, was staying in a nearby motel, and was \u201cjust passing\nthrough.\u201d During the course of the interaction, the officer reiterated that he made contact with\nWhitecotton because of the citizen\u2019s report. The officer advised that he did not think\nWhitecotton was doing anything \u201cwrong\u201d and that the officer planned to indicate in his report\nthat he spoke with Whitecotton.\nWhen the officer ran Whitecotton\u2019s name through dispatch, he learned that Whitecotton\u2019s\ndriving privileges were revoked due to a felony driving under the influence conviction in\nOregon. Although the officer detected a slight odor of alcohol on Whitecotton\u2019s breath,\nWhitecotton denied consuming any alcohol that day. Because the check revealed no other\npending charges or holds, the officer released Whitecotton after admonishing him not to drive.\n2Whitecotton thanked the officer, and the officer told Whitecotton to let the officer know if\nWhitecotton needs anything and to try not to \u201cscare people.\u201d\nAfter returning to his patrol vehicle, the officer observed Whitecotton back out of his\nparking space and begin driving away despite the officer\u2019s clear admonition moments before that\nWhitecotton could not legally drive, and his agreement that he would not. The officer pursued\nWhitecotton, who pulled into another parking spot just before entering the roadway. Upon\nreinitiating contact with Whitecotton, the officer informed Whitecotton that he could not legally\npossess a firearm due to his status as a convicted felon. The officer requested that Whitecotton\nrelinquish his firearm. He refused and fled in his vehicle. Whitecotton then led officers on a\nslow-speed chase. During the chase, dispatch notified the officer that Whitecotton had cautions\nfor weapons charges against officers and domestic violence. Despite being pursued by more\nthan one law enforcement vehicle with active sirens and emergency lights, Whitecotton did not\nstop until he reached the motel where he was staying. After pulling into the hotel parking lot,\nWhitecotton exited his vehicle while no longer wearing the gun holster. Whitecotton initially\ndisregarded repeated commands from armed officers to raise his hands and surrender, but was\nultimately arrested without further incident.\nAfter Whitecotton was taken into custody, officers found the fully loaded handgun in the\nvehicle Whitecotton was driving. A subsequent inventory search of the vehicle led to the\ndiscovery of a box of ammunition containing an additional twenty-five rounds for the handgun\nalong with a nearly empty bottle of whiskey.\nThe State charged Whitecotton with unlawful possession of a firearm. Whitecotton filed\na motion to suppress seeking suppression of \u201cany statement, including [his] identity, that was\nobtained after the illegal seizure.\u201d1 The parties waived hearing on the motion, stipulating to\nsubmit the matter on the briefs and on three exhibits--the officer\u2019s police report, the written\nstatement by the citizen who reported Whitecotton, and the video of the interactions with\nWhitecotton taken from the officer\u2019s body camera. The district court denied Whitecotton\u2019s\n1 The United States Supreme Court has held that the identity of a defendant in a criminal\ncase \u201cis never itself suppressible as a fruit of an unlawful arrest, even if it is conceded that an\nunlawful arrest, search, or interrogation occurred.\u201d Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v.\nLopez-Mendoza, 468 U.S. 1032, 1039 (1984).\n3motion, concluding that he was seized when the officer told Whitecotton to turn off his vehicle,\nbut the seizure was supported by reasonable suspicion.\nPursuant to a plea agreement, Whitecotton pled guilty to unlawful possession of a\nfirearm. In exchange for his plea, the State agreed to dismiss misdemeanor charges in other\ncases pending against Whitecotton. However, Whitecotton failed to appear for sentencing. He\nwas eventually arrested, and his sentencing hearing was rescheduled. During his rescheduled\nsentencing hearing, Whitecotton moved to withdraw his guilty plea. The district court granted\nthe motion and set the matter for a jury trial.\nA jury found Whitecotton guilty of unlawful possession of a firearm. Whitecotton\nsubsequently moved for reconsideration of his sentence under I.C.R. 35. After holding a\nhearing, the district court denied the motion. Whitecotton appeals.\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe standard of review of a suppression motion is bifurcated. When a decision on a\nmotion to suppress is challenged, we accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact that are supported by\nsubstantial evidence, but we freely review the application of constitutional principles to the facts\nas found. State v. Atkinson, 128 Idaho 559, 561, 916 P.2d 1284, 1286 (Ct. App. 1996). At a\nsuppression hearing, the power to assess the credibility of witnesses, resolve factual conflicts,\nweigh evidence, and draw factual inferences is vested in the trial court. State v. Valdez-Molina,\n127 Idaho 102, 106, 897 P.2d 993, 997 (1995); State v. Schevers, 132 Idaho 786, 789, 979 P.2d\n659, 662 (Ct. App. 1999). However, when we have \u201cexactly the same evidence before [us] as\nwas considered by the district court,\u201d we will freely review and weigh the evidence in the same\nmanner as the trial court.2 State v. Andersen, 164 Idaho 309, 312, 429 P.3d 850, 853 (2018).\nAn appellate review of a sentence is based on an abuse of discretion standard. State v.\nBurdett, 134 Idaho 271, 276, 1 P.3d 299, 304 (Ct. App. 2000). Where a sentence is not illegal,\nthe appellant has the burden to show that it is unreasonable and, thus, a clear abuse of discretion.\nState v. Brown, 121 Idaho 385, 393, 825 P.2d 482, 490 (1992). A sentence may represent such\nan abuse of discretion if it is shown to be unreasonable upon the facts of the case. State v. Nice,\n2 Nevertheless, we note that neither party challenges the district court\u2019s factual findings nor\ndo we see any basis for concluding those findings are erroneous.\n4103 Idaho 89, 90, 645 P.2d 323, 324 (1982). A sentence of confinement is reasonable if it\nappears at the time of sentencing that confinement is necessary to accomplish the primary\nobjective of protecting society and to achieve any or all of the related goals of deterrence,\nrehabilitation, or retribution applicable to a given case. State v. Toohill, 103 Idaho 565, 568, 650\nP.2d 707, 710 (Ct. App. 1982). Where an appellant contends that the sentencing court imposed\nan excessively harsh sentence, we conduct an independent review of the record, having regard\nfor the nature of the offense, the character of the offender, and the protection of the public\ninterest. State v. Reinke, 103 Idaho 771, 772, 653 P.2d 1183, 1184 (Ct. App. 1982). When\nreviewing the length of a sentence, we consider the defendant\u2019s entire sentence. State v. Oliver,\n144 Idaho 722, 726, 170 P.3d 387, 391 (2007).\nIII.\nANALYSIS\nA. Motion to Suppress\nWhitecotton argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress.\nSpecifically, Whitecotton asserts that, by failing to identify what specific criminal offense the\nofficer conducting the investigative detention had reasonable suspicion to investigate, the district\ncourt applied the incorrect legal standard to determine whether the investigative detention was\nlawful and that, according to the correct standard, insufficient reasonable suspicion existed for an\ninvestigative detention. The State argues that the district court correctly determined that the\ninvestigative detention was lawful because the officer had reasonable suspicion that some\ncriminal activity was afoot.3 We hold that the district court did not err in denying Whitecotton\u2019s\n3 In his reply brief, Whitecotton contends that the State\u2019s appellate argument must be\nlimited to the State\u2019s argument in district court that the officer had reasonable suspicion of a\n\u201cpotential theft, burglary, and/or robbery of the pharmacy or one of the nearby stores\u201d based on\n\u201cWhitecotton\u2019s behavior of pacing around in front of the pharmacy while armed\u201d and/or\nreasonable suspicion that \u201cWhitecotton could have been about to engage in some form of\nexhibiting a deadly weapon and/or committing an assault with said weapon\u201d based on\n\u201cWhitecotton\u2019s interjection into the conversation between the [reporting citizen] and her\nfriends.\u201d Because this preservation argument is subsumed by our analysis of Whitecotton\u2019s\nclaim regarding the proper legal standard for reasonable suspicion, it does not require a separate\nanalysis.\n5motion to suppress because the encounter between the officer and Whitecotton complied with the\nFourth Amendment.\nWe reject Whitecotton\u2019s assertion that the district court erred by failing to identify a\nspecific criminal offense related to Whitecotton\u2019s conduct. This Court has previously rejected\nthe argument that reasonable suspicion requires specific criminal activity. In State v.\nPerez-Jungo, 156 Idaho 609, 615, 329 P.3d 391, 397 (Ct. App. 2014), we held that reasonable\nsuspicion does not require a belief that any specific criminal activity is afoot to justify an\ninvestigative detention. Rather, all that is required is a showing of objective and specific\narticulable facts giving reason to believe that the individual has been or is about to be involved in\nsome criminal activity. Id. This holding is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s\ndescription of reasonable suspicion as it relates to criminal activity. See, e.g., United States v.\nArvizu, 534 U.S. 266, 272 (2002) (noting that the Fourth Amendment is satisfied if the officer\u2019s\naction is supported by reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may be afoot); Brown v. Texas,\n443 U.S. 47, 52 (1979) (noting that an officer must have reasonable suspicion, based on\nobjective facts, that the individual is involved in criminal activity).\nWhitecotton concedes that Perez-Jungo made \u201cclear that officers need not have\nreasonable suspicion of a specific crime,\u201d but contends there must still be an \u201coverarching\ncategor[y] of criminal conduct,\u201d as there was in Perez-Jungo.4 Whitecotton argues that no such\ncategory of criminal conduct exists in this case. Rather, Whitecotton contends that the detention\nwas based only on the reporting citizen\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d that Whitecotton was suspicious because he\nwas \u201changing around a public place with a firearm,\u201d which he characterizes as an \u201cinchoate\nhunch.\u201d5 In support of this argument, Whitecotton submitted the Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s opinion\n4 In Perez-Jungo, this Court concluded that the totality of circumstances supported a\ndetention to further investigate potential crimes involving impaired driving and illegal drug\nactivity. Perez-Jungo, 156 Idaho at 616, 329 P.3d at 398.\n5 Contrary to Whitecotton\u2019s claim, the citizen\u2019s concern was not that Whitecotton was\n\u201changing around a public place with a firearm,\u201d it was his behavior coupled with the fact that he\nwas armed. The State highlighted this point in its response to Whitecotton\u2019s motion: \u201cAs noted\nin her statement, [the citizen\u2019s] concern was directed at Whitecotton\u2019s behavior with the firearm,\nnot the mere fact that he was carrying a firearm.\u201d\n6in State v. Gonzales, 165 Idaho 667, 450 P.3d 315 (2019) as supplemental authority.6 In\nGonzales, the Idaho Supreme Court held:\nWhile we agree that finding an individual horizontal on the floor of a\nvehicle may be suspicious, without more it cannot be a sufficient basis on which\nan officer finds reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. The fatal flaws in the\nState\u2019s case are that [the officer] never articulated what criminal suspicion he had\nof Gonzales\u2019 behavior, other than the fact that Gonzales was perhaps hiding from\nhim. As we have iterated above, an officer must \u201chave a particularized and\nobjective basis for suspecting the particular person stopped of criminal activity.\u201d\nUnited States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. [411, 417-18 (1981)].\nGonzales, 165 Idaho at 774, 450 P.3d at 322 (citations omitted). We do not read Gonzales as\narticulating a new or different standard than the one stated in Perez-Jungo. Thus, we reject any\nclaim by Whitecotton to the contrary.\nThe reasonable suspicion standard was first articulated by the United States Supreme\nCourt in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). The Court opened the opinion in Terry by noting that\nthe case presented \u201cserious questions concerning the role of the Fourth Amendment in the\nconfrontation on the street between the citizen and the policeman investigating suspicious\ncircumstances.\u201d Id. at 4. In addressing those questions, the Court acknowledged that \u201cstreet\nencounters between citizens and police officers are incredibly rich in diversity\u201d and that such\nencounters are initiated \u201cfor a wide variety of purposes, some of which are wholly unrelated to a\ndesire to prosecute for crime.\u201d Id. at 13. Those encounters that cannot, as a practical matter, be\nsubjected to the warrant procedure are instead \u201ctested by the Fourth Amendment\u2019s general\nproscription against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Id. at 20 (quoting Camara v. Mun.\nCourt, 387 U.S. 523, 534-35 (1967)). The Court stated that there is \u201cno ready test for\ndetermining reasonableness other than by balancing the need to search (or seize) against the\ninvasion which the search (or seizure) entails.\u201d Id. at 21. \u201c[I]n justifying the particular intrusion\nthe police officers must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together\nwith rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.\u201d Id.\nThe United States Supreme Court elaborated on the meaning of reasonable suspicion in\nCortez, 449 U.S. at 417. The Court explained:\n6 The opinion in Gonzales was issued after this case was submitted on the briefs.\n7The idea that an assessment of the whole picture must yield a\nparticularized suspicion contains two elements, each of which must be present\nbefore a stop is permissible. First, the assessment must be based upon all the\ncircumstances. The analysis proceeds with various objective observations,\ninformation from police reports, if such are available, and consideration of the\nmodes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers. From these data, a\ntrained officer draws inferences and makes deductions--inferences and deductions\nthat might well elude an untrained person.\nThe process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities.\nLong before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people\nformulated certain common sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as\nfactfinders are permitted to do the same--and so are law enforcement officers.\nFinally, the evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of\nlibrary analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law\nenforcement.\nThe second element contained in the idea that an assessment of the whole\npicture must yield a particularized suspicion is the concept that the process just\ndescribed must raise a suspicion that the particular individual being stopped is\nengaged in wrongdoing. Chief Justice Warren, speaking for the Court in Terry v.\nOhio, supra, said that, \u201c[t]his demand for specificity in the information upon\nwhich police action is predicated is the central teaching of this Court\u2019s Fourth\nAmendment jurisprudence.\u201d Id., 392 U.S. at 21, n.18 (emphasis added).\nCortez, 449 U.S. at 418.\nThe encounter between Whitecotton and the officer passes constitutional muster under\nthe Fourth Amendment reasonableness standard articulated in Terry. The officer made contact\nwith Whitecotton because a concerned citizen went to the police department to report\n\u201csuspicious\u201d behavior.7 The officer described the report as follows:\n7 The reporting citizen also provided a written statement after Whitecotton\u2019s arrest. The\nstatement indicates that the incident occurred at 3:30 p.m. and reads as follows:\nI went into [a local pharmacy] and noticed a man pacing out front after I\npicked up my prescription he was inside asking about maps. I left and went into\n[a supermarket] to meet with my brother when we went outside we ran into my\nother brother and a few friends and we were talking. A few minutes into the\nconversation the same man walked up to us and shook my brother[\u2019]s hand and\nintroduced himself by first name. [H]e had a holstered gun on his side and he\nkept turning that side towards us which I thought was odd, he stood there while\nwe continued talking for a few minutes which again I thought was odd so when I\nleft I went to the P.D. and reported a suspicious person.\n8On 8/1/2016 at approximately 1620 hours, [a concerned citizen] and her\nbrother, . . . came into the police department to report a person acting suspiciously\nand strangely at [a local pharmacy]. They advised that this person, later identified\nto be David Whitecotton, had randomly approached them and other patrons,\nintroduced himself, then made a point to show off his sidearm to them. They\nwere concerned about [Whitecotton\u2019s] behavior.\nPrior to contacting Whitecotton, the officer was also aware that the subject of the report was \u201cin\na black Ford pick-up with Oregon license plates.\u201d When the officer arrived, Whitecotton was\nstill parked in his vehicle, facing the pharmacy. The officer\u2019s body camera video shows that the\nofficer parked several feet away from the vehicle, did not activate his lights or sirens, and\napproached the vehicle on foot. The officer\u2019s report articulated the following information\nrelevant to his conversation with Whitecotton:\na. [Whitecotton] had what he indicated to be a .44 revolver in a shoulder\nholster.\ni. I later confirmed that it was a Ruger .44 Magnum.\nb. I asked [Whitecotton] what was going on and he said nothing was going\non.\nc. [Whitecotton] started his pick-up instantly and said he was leaving.\nd. I instructed [Whitecotton] to turn the truck off so he could speak with me.\ne. I explained to [Whitecotton] the reason I was there.\nf. [Whitecotton] advised he went inside the store to ask them something.\ng. [Whitecotton] bought a football for a kid that he knows.\nh. I advised [Whitecotton] that I didn\u2019t see anything wrong with him buying\na football.\ni. I asked [Whitecotton] for his driver\u2019s license. [Whitecotton] was hesitant\nand made a show of looking through miscellaneous items in the car.\nj. [Whitecotton] kept changing the subject and was telling me what he did in\nthe store.\ni. [Whitecotton] said he was looking for his money in the store.\nii. He showed me the football he bought in the store.\nk. [Whitecotton] didn\u2019t want to show me his driver\u2019s license and finally\nshowed me a Veteran\u2019s identification card.\nl. While talking to [Whitecotton] he seemed to be hesitant and upset about\nme being there.\nm. A slight odor of an alcoholic beverage could be smelled coming from\n[Whitecotton\u2019s] breath.\ni. [Whitecotton] advised he had not been drinking.\nn. [Whitecotton] said he was carrying the gun because people are less likely\nto commit a crime when he is around.\no. [Whitecotton] lives in Oregon and is just passing by.\n9The video footage from the officer\u2019s body camera corroborates the observable facts set forth in\nthe officer\u2019s report. The footage also shows that upon approaching Whitecotton, the officer was\npolite, never drew his service weapon, did not attempt to disarm or physically restrain\nWhitecotton, or even ask him to step out of his vehicle. Instead, the officer initiated a consensual\nencounter with Whitecotton and explained his reason for doing so. The officer\u2019s subsequent\ninstruction to Whitecotton to turn off his vehicle and talk to him was reasonable under the\ncircumstances so that the officer could address and resolve the concerns reported by the citizen\nand complete his report. In short, the officer employed the least intrusive means in investigating\nthe citizen report, and his interaction with Whitecotton lasted no longer than was necessary. See\nFlorida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500-01 (1983) (noting that an investigative detention must last\nno longer than is necessary to effectuate its purpose and that law enforcement should employ the\nleast intrusive means reasonably available in confirming or dispelling suspicion).\nThat Whitecotton\u2019s behavior does not fall neatly within a specific category of criminal\nactivity does not mean the officer lacked the requisite suspicion to approach Whitecotton and\ninteract with him as the officer did. See Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146 (1972)\n(recognizing that a \u201cbrief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to\nmaintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable\nin light of the facts known to the officer at the time\u201d); cf. Baker v. Smiscik, 49 F. Supp. 3d 489,\n498 (E.D. Mich. 2014) (noting \u201clong-recognized concerns for the safety of police officers and\nthe public have taken on even greater urgency by recurrent tragedies triggered by gun violence in\npublic spaces\u201d and concluding that \u201c[t]o prevent such tragedies, police are properly given\nsufficient freedom of action to investigate circumstances that reasonably suggest an immediate\nrisk to officer or public safety\u201d). As explained in Terry, reasonableness under the Fourth\nAmendment requires balancing the need for the seizure against the invasion the seizure entails.\nTerry, 392 U.S. at 21. The balance in this case supports the conclusion that no Fourth\nAmendment violation occurred. A limited seizure to investigate and identify an armed\nindividual acting suspiciously by pacing and lingering in front of a business who at the same\ntime is behaving abnormally by interjecting himself into the conversation of strangers and\naccentuating the presence of his holstered firearm does not offend the Fourth Amendment. The\ndistrict court did not err in denying Whitecotton\u2019s motion to suppress.\n10B. Sentencing\nWhitecotton next argues the district court abused its discretion when sentencing him.\nSpecifically, Whitecotton argues, based upon a single statement by the district court during a\nhearing on a motion seeking a sentence reduction, that the district court failed to act according to\napplicable legal standards because it considered the fact that Whitecotton exercised his\nconstitutional right to a jury trial. The State responds that, when taken in context, the district\ncourt\u2019s allegedly improper statement does not indicate that Whitecotton was being punished for\nexercising a constitutional right. The State further argues that, even if the district court\nimproperly considered Whitecotton\u2019s demand for a jury trial, the district court did not abuse its\ndiscretion because Whitecotton\u2019s sentence is supported by other proper rationales.\nIt is improper for a court to penalize a defendant merely because he or she exercises the\nright to put the government to its proof at trial. State v. Kellis, 148 Idaho 812, 814, 229 P.3d\n1174, 1176 (Ct. App. 2010). We will not, however, vacate a sentence whenever a comment by a\ndistrict court implies a defendant is being punished for exercising his or her right to plead not\nguilty. State v. Brown, 131 Idaho 61, 72, 951 P.2d 1288, 1299 (Ct. App. 1998). Rather, a\nsentence will be vacated only when the totality of the circumstances indicates the district court\nsentenced a defendant based upon a vindictive or punitive motive. Id.\nWhitecotton contends that the following comment by the district court during a hearing\non his motion seeking a sentence reduction shows that his sentence was influenced by a desire to\npenalize him for exercising his right to a jury trial: \u201c[The Court] certainly had to look at the case\nmuch differently once [Whitecotton] withdrew that plea and required the State to prove his guilt\nto a jury.\u201d When viewed in isolation, this statement could be interpreted as evincing a motive to\npunish Whitecotton for asserting his right to a trial. However, the statement must be considered\nin light of the entire record. See id. The statement arose in the midst of the following larger\ndiscussion of Whitecotton\u2019s lack of cooperation with the justice system:\nLooking at whether or not further leniency with regard to the fixed\nsentence, [Whitecotton] had previously pled guilty, and we were set for\nsentencing, and [he] then just determined in his mind that he was not going to\nappear for sentencing, and so then we had to have him arrested, and then he\nwithdrew his plea, and he had his opportunity to go to trial.\n[The Court] certainly had to look at the case much differently once he\nwithdrew that plea and required the State to prove his guilt to a jury. I think the\n11two-year fixed sentence . . . is sufficient in order to accomplish the goals of\npunishment and protection of society. The three-year indeterminate sentence, I\nwould hope that he would be able to parole and be a productive citizen here in\neither Idaho or Oregon, but I think that would be the idea behind rehabilitation for\nhim.\nSo considering those goals of sentencing, I think the two-year fixed, three\nyears indeterminate sentence was appropriate under the circumstances. And so,\nbased on that, the Court is going to deny the Rule 35 motion.\n(Emphasis added.)\nIn context, the statement upon which Whitecotton relies is more properly interpreted as\nan observation by the district court that Whitecotton\u2019s conduct demonstrated his belief that he\ndid not have to comply with the court\u2019s orders and that he did not accept responsibility for his\nconduct. The district court noted that Whitecotton had a history of similar behavior. The court\ncould consider such factors when fashioning a sentence. See Brown, 131 Idaho at 73, 951 P.2d\nat 1300 (observing that a court can consider the failure to accept responsibility in relation to a\ndefendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation). The district court\u2019s single statement regarding\nWhitecotton\u2019s exercise of his right to a jury trial does not establish that his sentence violates\napplicable legal standards.8 Therefore, Whitecotton has failed to show that his sentence\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nThe district court correctly concluded that the officer had reasonable suspicion to detain\nWhitecotton. Thus, Whitecotton has failed to show that the district court erred in denying his\nmotion to suppress. Additionally, when viewed in the context of the entire record, the district\ncourt\u2019s comment regarding Whitecotton\u2019s decision to exercise his right to a jury trial does not\nestablish that any vindictive or punitive motive influenced his sentence. Thus, Whitecotton has\nfailed to show that his sentence constitutes an abuse of discrtion. Accordingly, Whitecotton\u2019s\njudgment of conviction and sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm are affirmed.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge BRAILSFORD, CONCUR.\n8 Because we conclude that the district court did not err in making a comment that could be\nconstrued as implying Whitecotton was being punished for exercising his right to a trial, we will\nnot consider the State\u2019s alternative argument that Whitecotton\u2019s sentence can be upheld despite\nconsideration of an improper rationale.\n12",

Civil No. 3-18-cv-02209)\nDistrict Judge: Honorable Robert D. Mariani\n____________________________________\nSubmitted for Possible Dismissal Due to a Jurisdictional Defect or\nSummary Action Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6\nNovember 7, 2019\nBefore: MCKEE, SHWARTZ and PHIPPS, Circuit Judges\n(Opinion filed: February 6, 2020)\n_________\nOPINION*\n_________\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.PER CURIAM\nPro se appellant Teresa Velardi appeals the decision of the District Court to\nremand this state ejectment action. For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm\nthe order of the District Court to the extent of our jurisdiction, see 3d Cir. LAR 27.4 and\nI.O.P. 10.6., and dismiss this appeal in all other respects.\nWilmington Savings Fund Society (\u201cWSFS\u201d) filed an action in state court over a\ndispute with Velardi regarding the fee simple ownership of real property located in\nClarks Summit, Pennsylvania, following a foreclosure sale. Velardi removed the action\nto the District Court, citing Public Law 39-26, a predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 that\nallowed for removal \u201cfor any cause whatsoever\u201d related to violations of the Civil Rights\nAct of 1866. See Notice of Removal 1, ECF No. 1; see also Act to Protect All Persons in\nthe United States in Their Civil Rights, and Furnish the Means of Their Vindication, Pub\nL. No. 39-26, 14 Stat. 27 (1866). On WSFS\u2019s timely motion, and upon adopting the\nreport and recommendation of a Magistrate Judge, the District Court remanded the matter\nto state court because Velardi did not state proper grounds for removal under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1443 and because the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction over district court orders remanding removed cases to\nstate court is constrained by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which states that an order remanding a\ncase to the state court from which it was removed is generally not reviewable on appeal.\nHowever, \u00a7 1447(d) allows for appellate review of cases that were properly removed\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. As such, we have jurisdiction to review the remand order\nto the extent Velardi asserted that removal was proper under \u00a7 1443, see Davis v.\n2Glanton, 107 F.3d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1997), and our review of that legal issue is\nplenary, see Lazorko v. Pa. Hosp., 237 F.3d 242, 247 (3d Cir. 2000).1 To the extent that\nVelardi challenges the District Court\u2019s remand order with respect to any other basis for\nremoval, we will dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction. See Davis, 107 F.3d at\n1047; see also Agostini v. Piper Aircraft Corp., 729 F.3d 350, 355-56 (3d Cir. 2013).\nRemoval under \u00a7 1443(1) is appropriate when a state court defendant \u201cis being\ndeprived of rights guaranteed by a federal law \u2018providing for . . . equal civil rights\u2019\u201d and\ncannot enforce those rights in state court. Davis, 107 F.3d at 1047. Velardi asserted that\nthis case involves an invasion upon her civil rights. See Notice of Removal 2, ECF No.\n2. However, Velardi\u2019s claim to a right to retain a fee simple in her real property is not a\nright guaranteed by a federal law providing for equal civil rights. See Rachel, 384 U.S. at\n792 (construing \u201cequal civil rights\u201d to mean federal laws that specifically guarantee racial\nequality). Nor did Velardi show that she was denied or cannot enforce her rights in state\ncourt.2 Likewise, \u00a7 1443(2) is inapplicable here. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(2) (permitting\n1 We agree with the District Court that Velardi sought removal under \u00a7 1443 although\nshe did not name \u00a7 1443 in her notice of removal and stated that removal was \u201ceffected\nonly under Public Law 39-26 and not pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 or any other section\nof Title 28.\u201d See Brief 3, ECF No. 4 (emphasis omitted); see also Erickson v. Pardus,\n551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam) (noting the obligation to construe pro se filings\nliberally). As the District Court recounted in its thorough history of the relevant law,\nPublic Law 39-26 became what is now 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. See Georgia v. Rachel, 384\nU.S. 780, 786 (1966) (observing that \u201c[t]he present statute is a direct descendant of a\nprovision enacted as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1866\u201d).\n2 Velardi claimed that \u201cthe state court itself and its employees are involved in the\nintentional violations of Velardi\u2019s inalienable rights under Article V and the 14th\nAmendment.\u201d Brief 7, ECF No. 4. However, this bald accusation is not enough to\nwarrant removal under \u00a7 1443(1). Velardi has not identified any Pennsylvania law that\nwould preclude her from vindicating her rights or otherwise shown that she could not\n3removal where a civil action has been initiated against a defendant \u201c[f]or any act under\ncolor of authority derived from any law providing for equal rights, or for refusing to do\nany act on the ground that it would be inconsistent with such law\u201d). Accordingly, the\nDistrict Court did not err in remanding Velardi\u2019s case over her claim that it should be\nremoved under \u00a7 1443, and we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment to the extent of\nour jurisdiction.\nenforce those rights in the Pennsylvania courts. See Johnson v. Mississippi, 421 U.S.\n213, 219-22 (1975).\n4",

See Chochaev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 783 F.\nApp\u2019x 967, 968 (11th Cir. 2019).\nChochaev\u2019s present petition raises four arguments. First, he asserts that the\nBIA erred by rejecting his argument that his serious illness and his prior attorneys\u2019\nineffective assistance amounted to exceptional circumstances that excused his\nfailure to appear at his removal hearing, rendering his in absentia order of removal\ninappropriate. Second, he contends that the BIA erred by ignoring In re\nVelarde-Pacheco, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253 (B.I.A. 2002), overruled on other grounds\nby Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. 688 (B.I.A. 2012), in its decision declining\nto reopen his proceedings based on his marriage to a lawful permanent resident\n(LPR) and his pending visa petition. Third, he argues that the BIA erred in\ndeclining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his case. Finally, Chochaev\n2Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 3 of 11\nmaintains that the IJ lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his proceedings in light\nof Pereira v. Sessions, 138 S. Ct. 2105 (2018), because his notice to appear (NTA)\ndid not specify the time and location of his removal hearing.1\nWe conclude that the law-of-the-case doctrine forecloses Chochaev\u2019s first,\nthird, and fourth arguments because they were raised in rejected in connection with\nhis earlier petition. With respect to his second argument\u2014that the BIA abused its\ndiscretion by refusing to reopen his proceedings based on his marriage and his\npending visa petition\u2014we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion.\nAccordingly, we affirm.\nII\nA\nThe facts of this case are familiar to the parties, so we will proceed directly\nto the merits of Chochaev\u2019s claims. \u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to\nreopen and its denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d Scheerer\nv. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 513 F.3d 1244, 1252 (11th Cir. 2008). \u201c[R]eview is limited to\ndetermining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and\nwhether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y\n1 In Pereira, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[a] notice [to appear] that does not inform a\nnoncitizen when and where to appear for removal proceedings is not a notice to appear under\nsection 1229(a).\u201d 138 S. Ct. at 2110 (internal quotation marks omitted). But this Court has\nsubsequently held that a \u201cdeficient NTA [under Pereira] d[oes] not deprive the agency of\njurisdiction over . . . removal proceedings.\u201d Perez-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 935 F.3d 1148,\n1150 (11th Cir. 2019).\n3Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 4 of 11\nGen., 443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 430\nF.3d 1148, 1149 (11th Cir. 2005)).\nAn alien may move the BIA to reconsider \u201cany case in which it has rendered\na decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(A). The alien\u2019s\n\u201cmotion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors\nof fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent\nauthority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201c[M]erely reiterating arguments previously\npresented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying . . . errors of fact or law\u2019 as\nrequired for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 504 F.3d\n1324, 1329 (11th Cir. 2007) (alteration in original) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\n1003.2(b)(1)).\nB\nUnder the law-of-the-case doctrine, an appellate court\u2019s factual findings and\nlegal conclusions \u201care generally binding in all subsequent proceedings in the same\ncase in the trial court or on a later appeal.\u201d Mega Life & Health Ins. Co. v.\nPieniozek, 585 F.3d 1399, 1405 (11th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted). The doctrine does not apply \u201cif, since the prior decision, new\nand substantially different evidence is produced, or there has been a change in\ncontrolling authority.\u201d Oladeinde v. City of Birmingham, 230 F.3d 1275, 1288\n(11th Cir. 2000). Neither of these exceptions applies to this appeal.\n4Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 5 of 11\nHere, the law-of-the-case doctrine forecloses the arguments that Chochaev\nraises in his petition regarding (1) the alleged insufficiency of his NTA under\nPereria, (2) the alleged exceptional circumstances warranting the reopening of his\nremoval proceedings, and (3) the BIA\u2019s refusal to exercise sua sponte authority to\nreopen his case.\n1\nIn our prior opinion, this Court held that \u201cChochaev failed to exhaust\u201d his\nPereira-based claim that his NTA was insufficient\u2014because he did not raise it in\nany of his immigration proceedings, we held that \u201cwe . . . lack[ed] jurisdiction to\nconsider it.\u201d Chochaev, 783 F. App\u2019x at 968\u201369. And, even if he had exhausted,\nwe held that his Pereira claim would still fail on the merits, because \u201ca notice to\nappear that does not specify the time and place of an alien\u2019s initial hearing is a\ncharging document that vests the IJ with jurisdiction provided (as happened here)\nthat it is followed by a notice of hearing that supplies the missing scheduling\ninformation.\u201d Id. at 969 (emphasis in original). These holdings are \u201cbinding in\n[these] subsequent proceedings in the same case . . . .\u201d Mega Life, 585 F.3d at\n1405.\n2\nWith respect to Chochaev\u2019s exceptional-circumstances claim, we held in our\nearlier opinion that the evidence that he provided to document the serious illness\n5Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 6 of 11\nthat allegedly prevented his attendance at the hearing was \u201cinsufficient,\u201d so \u201cthe\nBIA and IJ did not err in finding that Chochaev\u2019s illness was not an exceptional\ncircumstance.\u201d Id. at 970.2 Additionally, this Court held that \u201c[n]one of the\nactions or omissions by Chochaev\u2019s lawyers had a direct bearing on his attendance\nof the hearing or prevented him from contacting the IJ himself to inform her of his\nillness.\u201d Id. at 971. Indeed, \u201c[b]oth of his prior attorneys advised him to attend his\nhearing, and Chochaev indicated he understood that he was required to attend the\nhearing.\u201d Id. On top of that, \u201cChochaev represented in multiple filings that he\nwould have attended the hearing but for his illness; he made no claims about his\nattorneys\u2019 actions preventing his attendance.\u201d Id. This Court held, therefore, that\n\u201c[i]t was not an abuse of discretion for the BIA to deny Chochaev\u2019s motion to\nreopen\u201d on these grounds. Id. Again, that holding controls in this subsequent\nstage of the same proceeding.\n3\nLastly, this Court held that it \u201clack[ed] jurisdiction to review Chochaev\u2019s\nargument regarding the BIA\u2019s sua sponte authority to reopen his case, a[s] he ha[d]\nnot raised any specific constitutional claims relating to the denial of sua sponte\n2 As we noted in our prior opinion, \u201cChochaev provided only a photocopy of the bill and a\ndoctor\u2019s note\u2014which stated in its entirety, \u2018was examined on 7/28/2017 may refuse to work\n7/30/2017\u2019\u2014and affidavits from himself and his wife as evidence that he suffered from a serious\nillness and could not travel to his hearing.\u201d Chochaev, 783 F. App\u2019x at 970.\n6Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 7 of 11\nreopening.\u201d Id. at 972. This Court, therefore, \u201cdismiss[ed] Chochaev\u2019s petition as\nto this issue.\u201d Id. Because Chochaev still has not presented any specific\nconstitutional claims, we continue to lack jurisdiction to review his contention.\n* * *\nSo, in short, the law-of-the-case doctrine forecloses Chochaev\u2019s arguments\nconcerning all three of these issues. We turn, then, to his remaining argument,\npertaining to the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen his proceedings based on his\nmarriage to an LPR and his pending visa petition.\nIII\nThe INA gives the Attorney General the discretion to adjust the status of an\nalien to that of an LPR if \u201c(1) the alien makes an application for such adjustment,\n(2) the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the United\nStates for permanent residence, and (3) an immigrant visa is immediately available\nto him at the time his application is filed.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). When an alien\nmarries a U.S. citizen, the citizen-spouse may file an I-130 petition, which, if\napproved, \u201cprovides the evidentiary basis for the beneficiary\u2019s adjustment of status\nvia Form I\u2013485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.\u201d\nAlvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 524 F.3d 1191, 1194 n.6 (11th Cir. 2008). LPRs\nmay also file such petitions on behalf of their alien spouses. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\n1153(a)(2), 1154(a)(1)(A)(i), (B)(i)(I).\n7Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 8 of 11\nFor spouses of U.S. citizens, the number of visas issued each year is not\ncapped, so visas are automatically available to citizens\u2019 spouses once their\npaperwork is approved. Id. \u00a7 1151(b)(2)(A)(i). The number of visas available to\nspouses of LPRs, however, is limited by statute\u2014as a result, visas will not\nnecessarily be automatically available to LPRs\u2019 spouses when their paperwork is\napproved. Id. \u00a7 1153(a)(2), (e)(1), (3); see, e.g., Dinanto v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 410 F.\nApp\u2019x 204, 206\u201307 (11th Cir. 2010). Rather, their visas are \u201cissued to eligible\nimmigrants in the order in which a petition in behalf of each such immigrant is\nfiled with the Attorney General,\u201d and applicants may be put on a waiting list\n\u201cmaintained in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State\u201d\nuntil visas become available. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2), (e)(1), (3).\nGenerally, an alien may not have his status adjusted under \u00a7 1255(a) while\nhe is seeking an immigrant visa on the basis of a marriage that was entered into\nwhile removal proceedings are pending\u2014as is the case here. 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1255(e)(1)\u2013(2). However, pursuant to the \u201cbona fide marriage exception,\u201d this\nbar to adjustment of status\u2014\nshall not apply with respect to a marriage if the alien establishes by\nclear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney\nGeneral that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in\naccordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place\nand the marriage was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the\nalien\u2019s admission as an immigrant . . . .\nId. \u00a7 1255(e)(3).\n8Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 9 of 11\nIn In re Velarde-Pacheco, the BIA granted an alien\u2019s motion to reopen\nwhere the alien married a U.S. citizen after he had been ordered removed from the\ncountry. 23 I. & N. Dec. at 254. The alien and his spouse filed an I-130 petition\nand an I-485 application to adjust his status after entry of the order of removal. Id.\nIn his motion to reopen, the alien argued that he should be given the opportunity to\nadjust his status to that of an LPR as a result of his marriage, and as evidence of the\nbona fide nature of his marriage he attached his marriage certificate, copies of\nfiling fee receipts for the I-130 and I-485 forms, his U.S. citizen son\u2019s birth\ncertificate, and an affidavit attesting that he had known his wife for at least two\nyears before he was ordered removed. Id. at 254, 256.\nThe BIA determined that, under those circumstances, a motion to reopen\nmay be granted as a matter of discretion where: \u201c(1) the motion is timely filed; (2)\nthe motion is not numerically barred . . . (3) the motion is not barred . . . on any\nother procedural grounds; (4) the motion presents clear and convincing evidence\nindicating a strong likelihood that the respondent\u2019s marriage is bona fide; and (5)\u201d\nthe motion is unopposed. Id. at 256. The BIA emphasized that it was \u201cnot\nendors[ing] granting adjustment of status in every case in which a respondent\nmakes a prima facie showing of eligibility\u201d and that its decision did \u201cnot require\nImmigration Judges to reopen proceedings pending adjudication of an I-130 visa\n9Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 10 of 11\npetition in every case in which the respondent meets all five of the aforementioned\nfactors.\u201d Id. at 256\u201357.3\nHere, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chochaev\u2019s motion\nbased on his present ineligibility for adjustment of status. First and foremost,\nVelarde-Pacheco gives the BIA the discretion to grant motions to reopen when its\nfive factors are met\u2014it doesn\u2019t mandate anything. See id. at 256. Moreover, in\nhis motion for reconsideration, Chochaev didn\u2019t assert that a visa would be\nimmediately available to him once his petition was approved. Indeed, Chochaev\nadmitted in his motion that his \u201cspouse [wa]s in the process of becoming a US\nCitizen\u201d and that he \u201cw[ould] be able to adjust his status to that of a Lawful\nPermanent Resident once [his] I-130 [wa]s approved and once his spouse [wa]s\nnaturalized.\u201d\nBecause Chochaev\u2019s wife was not yet a U.S. citizen at the time,4 his case is\nfundamentally different from Velarde-Pacheco, where the petitioner\u2019s spouse was\na U.S. citizen. Chochaev\u2014as the spouse of an LPR\u2014would not necessarily have\n3 The government argues that because \u201cVelarde-Pacheco applies to only timely-filed motions to\nreopen for adjustment of status, and Chochaev\u2019s was untimely,\u201d its rationale shouldn\u2019t apply to\nhim. Appellee\u2019s Br. at 21. We needn\u2019t address that contention. The BIA does not appear to\nhave addressed the timeliness of Chochaev\u2019s petition in its decision. Moreover, even if we were\nto treat the petition as timely filed, the reasoning of Velarde-Pacheco still wouldn\u2019t support\nChochaev\u2019s argument, for the reasons explained below.\n4 It\u2019s worth noting that the BIA appears to mistakenly assert that Chochaev\u2019s spouse was already\na U.S. citizen in its order. But, Chochaev\u2019s application and brief clearly indicate that his spouse\nwas still an LPR at the time.\n10Case: 19-12332 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 11 of 11\nhad a visa automatically available to him once his petition was approved, as he\nwould be subject to the statutory caps in place for spouses of LPRs, and he could\nhave to wait in line behind other family-sponsored immigrants of a higher\npreference level and/or application date. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153(a)(2), (e)(1), (3).\nChochaev has presented no evidence that, despite these statutory barriers, he would\nhave been able to get a visa immediately once his petition was approved. Thus, the\nBIA was well within its discretion to deny Chochaev\u2019s petition. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1255(a).\nPETITION DENIED.\n11",

City of\nGarden Grove, 666 F. App\u2019x 649, 653 (9th Cir. 2016), the district court ordered\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).briefing on whether Officer Ray Bex was entitled to qualified immunity. The court\nsubsequently granted summary judgment to Officer Bex on qualified immunity\ngrounds. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history of\nthis case, we do not recite them here.\nTo determine whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity, a court\nconsiders \u201c(1) whether there has been a violation of a constitutional right; and (2)\nwhether that right was clearly established at the time of the officer\u2019s alleged\nmisconduct.\u201d Lal v. California, 746 F.3d 1112, 1116 (9th Cir. 2014). A court may\nconsider these two factors in either order. Id. We resolve this appeal on the\n\u201cclearly established\u201d prong.\nMackovski admits that there is no case directly on point establishing that the\nforce Officer Bex used was unreasonable. Plaintiffs do not need case law that is\nexactly on point, but existing precedent must place the contours of the right\n\u201cbeyond debate.\u201d White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (quoting Mullenix v.\nLuna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015)). Mackovski relies on Smith v. City of Hemet,\n394 F.3d 689 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) and Curnow ex rel. Curnow v. Ridgecrest\nPolice, 952 F.2d 321 (9th Cir. 1991), but neither are sufficient to support his\nburden. Therefore, Officer Bex is entitled to qualified immunity.\n2The law of the case doctrine does not apply to Mackovski\u2019s current appeal\nbecause the prior panel did not consider qualified immunity.

O\u2019BRYANT, ) No. 11CF99\nDefendant-Appellant. )\n) Honorable\n) Heidi N. Ladd,\n) Judge Presiding.\nPRESIDING JUSTICE STEIGMANN delivered the judgment of the court.\nJustices Cavanagh and Holder White concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: The appellate court granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw because no meritorious\nissues could be raised on appeal.\n\u00b6 2 This case comes to us on the motion of the Office of the State Appellate Defender\n(OSAD) to withdraw as counsel. In September 2017, defendant, Gary A. O\u2019Bryant, filed a\nmotion for revocation of fines pursuant to section 5-9-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections\n(Code) (730 ILCS 5/5-9-2 (West 2016)), asserting he had no means to pay his fines while\nincarcerated and would be unable to find employment after his projected release from custody.\nThe trial court issued an order denying his section 5-9-2 motion, and defendant appealed.\n\u00b6 3 In September 2019, OSAD filed a motion to withdraw. In its brief, OSAD\ncontends that appeal of this case would be without arguable merit. We agree, grant OSAD\u2019s\nmotion to withdraw as counsel, and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\u00b6 4 I. BACKGROUND\u00b6 5 A. Procedural History\n\u00b6 6 In January 2011, the State charged defendant with (1) possession with intent to\ndeliver a controlled substance (count I) (720 ILCS 570/401(a)(2)(A) (West 2010));\n(2) possession of a controlled substance (count II) (id. \u00a7 402(c)); and (3) possession of 15 grams\nor more of a controlled substance (count III) (id. \u00a7 402(a)(2)(A)).\n\u00b6 7 In June 2011, defendant waived his right to jury trial and entered a partially-\nnegotiated plea agreement to count III. In exchange for defendant\u2019s pleading guilty, the State\n(1) dismissed counts I and II and (2) agreed to cap its sentence recommendation to 18 years\u2019\nimprisonment and a street value fine of $8600.\n\u00b6 8 In July 2011, the trial court imposed a sentence of 15 years in prison, 3 years of\nmandatory supervised release, an analysis fee of $100, a violent crime victims assistance fee, a\ngenetic marker grouping analysis fee of $200, a $3000 mandatory assessment, and the $8600\nmandatory street value fine, with credit for 194 days in pretrial detention.\n\u00b6 9 B. The Motion for Revocation of a Fine\n\u00b6 10 In September 2017, defendant filed a motion for revocation of a fine pursuant to\nsection 5-9-2 of the Code (730 ILCS 5/5-9-2 (West 2016)), asking the court to revoke $22,679 in\nfines. Defendant alleged the following as \u201cgood cause\u201d for his inability to pay his fines:\n\u201c1. [Defendant] must find housing to parole to.\n2. [Defendant] must find employment as an ex-offender.\n3. [Defendant] may have to attend programs for rehabilitation possibly\nrecomended [sic] by the Prisoner Review Board, and pay fees for attendance.\n4. [Defendant] has no family with the financial means to assist him upon\nrelease.\u201d\n- 2 -Defendant also filed affidavits that showed he earned $28.80 a month, had accumulated $1109 in\nhis prisoner trust account over six years, and had no other source of funds to enable him to\n\u201csecure housing, driver\u2019s license, secure utilities, or any of the other expenses I will incure [sic]\nstarting my life over.\u201d\n\u00b6 11 In September 2017, the trial court made a docket entry denying defendant\u2019s\nmotion. The court stated that the fine imposed was a part of the negotiated plea and gave\ndefendant 24 months to pay the fine. The court further stated, \u201cThe defendant is to make all good\nfaith and reasonable efforts to pay the fine, consistent with his financial circumstances, upon\nrelease from incarceration.\u201d\n\u00b6 12 Defendant filed a motion to reconsider in November 2017, asking the court to\nreduce the fines related to the automation, circuit clerk fee, victim fund fee, state police\noperations fee, \u201cTR/CR Sur,\u201d the spinal cord fee, clerk operations fee, and trauma fund because\nthese fees were not to help the State prosecute him. The trial court denied the motion in\nDecember 2017.\n\u00b6 13 C. The Current Appeal and OSAD\u2019s Motion To Withdraw\n\u00b6 14 In December 2017, defendant filed a notice of appeal, and OSAD was appointed\nto represent defendant. In September 2019, OSAD filed a motion to withdraw, stating that no\nmeritorious issue could be raised on appeal and served a copy on defendant. Neither the State nor\ndefendant have filed a response. We agree with OSAD, grant the motion to withdraw as counsel,\nand affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\u00b6 15 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 16 A. The Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\u00b6 17 Section 5-9-2 of the Code provides that \u201cthe court, upon good cause shown, may\n- 3 -revoke the fine or the unpaid portion or may modify the method of payment.\u201d 730 ILCS 5/5-9-2\n(West 2016). \u201cA section 5-9-2 petition is a freestanding collateral action, \u2018allowing defendants to\nseek financial relief at any appropriate time.\u2019 \u201d People v. Grigorov, 2017 IL App (1st) 143274,\n\u00b6 5, 91 N.E.3d 390 (quoting People v. Mingo, 403 Ill. App. 3d 968, 972, 936 N.E.2d 1156, 1159\n(2010)). The Second District has explained that the purpose of the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement in\nsection 5-9-2 is \u201cto provide a defendant relief from fines when factors, external to the original\nproceedings, would warrant the revocation of the fines to ease a defendant\u2019s financial burden.\u201d\nMingo, 403 Ill. App. 3d at 972. \u201c[T]o warrant revocation of a defendant\u2019s fines, [the] defendant\nmust establish \u2018good cause,\u2019 which is an \u2018inability to pay\u2019 or a \u2018hardship\u2019 that prevents him from\npaying the fines imposed by the court.\u201d People v. Barajas, 2018 IL App (3d) 160433, \u00b6 10, 115\nN.E.3d 459 (quoting 730 ILCS Ann. 5/5-9-2, Council Comments-1973, at 303 (Smith-Hurd\n2007)).\n\u00b6 18 The appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s ruling on a section 5-9-2 motion for an\nabuse of discretion. See Barajas, 2018 IL App (3d) 160433, \u00b6 11 (applying an abuse of\ndiscretion standard); see also People v. One 1998 GMC, 2011 IL 110236, \u00b6 16, 960 N.E.2d 1071\n(noting that the legislative use of \u201cmay\u201d is generally regarded as indicating a permissive or\ndirectory reading). A trial court abuses its discretion when its decision is \u201carbitrary, fanciful, or\nunreasonable to the degree that no reasonable person would agree with it.\u201d People v. McDonald,\n2016 IL 118882, \u00b6 32, 77 N.E.3d 26. In the context of section 5-9-2, a trial court may also abuse\nits discretion by \u201cexpand[ing] the good cause standard beyond inability to pay or hardship.\u201d\nBarajas, 2018 IL App (3d) 160433, \u00b6 11.\n\u00b6 19 B. This Case\n\u00b6 20 OSAD argues that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied\n- 4 -defendant\u2019s section 5-9-2 motion on the grounds that he had agreed to the fines as part of his\nnegotiated plea and had failed to show good cause. Additionally, it notes the motion did not have\nmerit because the motion was filed while defendant was still incarcerated, so he could not\ninclude any historical facts or evidence regarding failed efforts to find employment. We agree\nwith OSAD that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the section 5-9-2 motion.\n\u00b6 21 Although defendant was imprisoned and had minimal income, no assets, no post-\nrelease employment in place, and no family assistance, this showing alone cannot establish a\nshowing of good cause to warrant the revocation of negotiated fines. Defendant\u2019s financial\nsituation while in prison is hardly unexpected or unique. The phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d would be\nmeaningless if it included such circumstances, which are known and anticipated by the trial court\nat the time of sentencing and applicable to many if not most defendants. Barring any historical or\nevidentiary showing that defendant has attempted to gain employment and has been historically\nunsuccessful, the mere assertation that defendant will have trouble obtaining employment cannot\nestablish a showing of good cause.\n\u00b6 22 Further, the trial court noted that \u201c[t]he fine imposed was part of the negotiated\nplea.\u201d As a result, that fine itself cannot be considered a factor \u201cexternal to the original\nproceedings.\u201d We conclude that \u201cexternal to the original proceedings\u201d differentiates between\ninternal factors, such as the prison sentence and its impact on future employment, and external\nfactors, such as being diagnosed with cancer or becoming disabled. The factors that defendant\ncomplains of are intrinsic to his being convicted and sentenced to prison, and therefore, they do\nnot qualify as factors \u201cexternal to the original proceedings.\u201d\n\u00b6 23 Finally, the court also modified the conditions of the fines imposed on defendant,\ngranting him an additional two years from the date of his release to make payment, and further\n- 5 -ordered defendant \u201cto make all good faith and reasonable efforts to pay the fine, consistent with\nhis financial circumstances, upon release from incarceration.\u201d As this court has noted, section 5-\n9-2 is a safeguard \u201cfor those who in good faith are unable to pay a fine.\u201d People v. Ruff, 115 Ill.\nApp. 3d 691, 695, 450 N.E.2d 1369, 1373 (1983). And \u201cthere is no limit on the filing of\nsuccessive section 5-9-2 petitions in the trial court.\u201d Grigorov, 2017 IL App (1st) 143274, \u00b6 23.\nGiven this context, we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying the section\n5-9-2 motion.\n\u00b6 24 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 25 For the reasons stated, we agree with OSAD that no meritorious issue can be\nraised on appeal. We therefore grant OSAD\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel and affirm the trial\ncourt\u2019s judgment.\n\u00b6 26 Affirmed.\n- 6 -",

Wade\nDefendant - Appellant\n____________\nAppeal from United States District Court\nfor the Eastern District of Missouri - Cape Girardeau\n____________\nSubmitted: December 9, 2019\nFiled: February 7, 2020\n[Unpublished]\n____________\nBefore ERICKSON, ARNOLD, and MELLOY, Circuit Judges.\n____________\nPER CURIAM.\nKyle T. Wade pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). After determining that Wade qualified for\nsentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), the district court\nsentenced Wade to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum. 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 924(e)(1). Wade appeals, contending the district court violated the SixthAmendment when it found, for ACCA purposes, that Wade had committed two\nprevious offenses charged in a single indictment on occasions different from one\nanother. Wade claims that under the Sixth Amendment this was a fact for a jury to\nfind. Because this argument is foreclosed by our precedent, we affirm.\nOn October 2, 2018, Wade pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated that because Wade\nhad three previous drug-related convictions, he qualified for a sentencing\nenhancement under ACCA. One conviction was for possession of a controlled\nsubstance with intent to distribute, in violation of Missouri law. The other two were\nfederal convictions for distribution of cocaine. The federal charges were brought in\nthe same indictment, which, along with the plea agreement in that case, made clear\nthat Wade had engaged in the conduct underlying one of the charges on February 24,\n2012, and the conduct underlying the other charge on October 5, 2012.\nThe district court rejected Wade\u2019s argument that his Missouri state conviction\ndid not count as a serious drug offense under ACCA. Wade asserts a new argument\non appeal. He claims the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it, instead\nof a jury, decided the question of whether the conduct underlying Wade\u2019s two federal\ndrug offenses took place on different occasions. Wade\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our\nprecedent. United States v. Harris, 794 F.3d 885, 887 (8th Cir. 2015). Even though\nthere has been recent discussion about the lasting viability of this holding in light of\nrecent Supreme Court precedent, United States v. Perry, 908 F.3d 1126, 1134-36 (8th\nCir. 2018) (Stras, J., concurring), we are bound by a prior panel\u2019s decision, Mader v.\nUnited States, 654 F.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\nWe affirm Wade\u2019s fifteen-year sentence under ACCA.\n______________________________\n-2-",

The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d)\ndenied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).1 Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision\nwhile adding its own reasons, we review both decisions. Nuru v. Gonzales, 404\nF.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir. 2005). We deny the petition for review.\n1. Despite the defects in the Notice to Appear, the IJ had jurisdiction to\nconduct removal proceedings as set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14(a). See Karingithi\nv. Whitaker, 913 F.3d 1158, 1160-61 (9th Cir. 2019) (holding that \u201ca notice to\nappear that does not specify the time and place of an alien\u2019s initial removal hearing\nvests an [IJ] with jurisdiction over the removal proceedings so long as a notice of\nhearing specifying this information is later sent to the alien\u201d (alteration omitted)\n(quoting Matter of Bermudez-Cota, 27 I. & N. Dec. 441, 447 (BIA 2018)). After\nthe initial Notice to Appear, Barrientos-Lopez was provided subsequent notice of\nthe time and place of the hearings, and he appeared at the scheduled hearings. See\nid. at 1161-62. Accordingly, we also have jurisdiction over this appeal.\n2. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Barrientos-Lopez\nfailed to establish a nexus between any harm he may suffer and a protected ground,\nbecause his three proposed social groups\u2014\u201cMexicans with mental disabilities,\u201d\n\u201cMexicans with schizophrenia who do not have access to adequate mental health\n1 Barrientos-Lopez did not challenge the denial of cancellation of removal in\nhis opening brief. Thus, it is waived. Martinez-Serrano v. INS, 94 F.3d 1256,\n1260 (9th Cir. 1996).\n2services,\u201d or \u201cMexicans with mental illness whose mental health causes them to\nbehave erratically\u201d\u2014 were not cognizable.2 See Reyes v. Lynch, 842 F.3d 1125,\n1131 (9th Cir. 2016). Although Barrientos-Lopez submitted evidence of how\nLatinos in the United States and Latin America perceive persons with mental\nillness, nothing in the record or in the BIA\u2019s decision demonstrates that the BIA\nmischaracterized or misinterpreted the submitted evidence. Further, the evidence\ndoes not compel a conclusion that Mexican society perceives persons with mental\nillness as a distinct group. See id. at 1137-38.\nAccordingly, because Barrientos-Lopez has failed to establish a cognizable\nsocial group, he has not met his burden of establishing eligibility for asylum or\nwithholding of removal. See Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.\n2003).\n3. Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s decision that it is not more likely\nthan not that Barrientos-Lopez will be subjected to torture in Mexico, or that any\ntorture would be at the hands of or acquiescence of the Mexican government.\nBarrientos-Lopez submitted the Disability Rights International report,\n2 With regard to the first two proposed social groups, Barrientos-Lopez fails\nto challenge the BIA\u2019s conclusions for rejecting the social group, arguing instead\nthat the BIA misinterpreted the evidence. Accordingly, Barrientos-Lopez waived\nany challenge to these findings. Martinez-Serrano, 94 F.3d at 1260.\n3documenting the maltreatment of persons institutionalized in Mexican mental\nhealth facilities. However, this evidence, by itself, does not compel a conclusion\nthat he will be tortured. See Cole v.

Baylson\n______________\nSubmitted pursuant to Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a)\nFebruary 3, 2020\n______________\nBefore: SHWARTZ, SCIRICA, and RENDELL, Circuit Judges.\n(Filed: February 11, 2020)______________\nOPINION*\n______________\nSHWARTZ, Circuit Judge.\nPlaintiff Felicita Sanchez-Garcia brought a personal injury suit against the United\nStates under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). The parties agreed to settle the case\nfor $75,000, but disputes arose concerning other settlement terms. Sanchez-Garcia\nmoved to enforce the settlement. The District Court granted the motion and the United\nStates sent the settlement check to Sanchez-Garcia.\nAn appeal bearing Sanchez-Garcia\u2019s name was filed, but the brief in support of the\nappeal raises issues that impact only Sanchez-Garcia\u2019s counsel (\u201cCounsel\u201d). Because\nSanchez-Garcia has not been injured by the order enforcing the settlement, and because\nthe notice of appeal fails to comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(c), we\nwill dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nI\nSanchez-Garcia slipped and fell at a United States Post Office and brought an\nFTCA action against the United States. The United States filed a third-party complaint\nagainst the building\u2019s landlord, Tacony 19135, LLC, and the City of Philadelphia. The\nparties agreed to settle the case, but counsel for the parties could not agree on: (1)\nlanguage related to the responsibility for taxes; (2) whether Counsel needed to sign the\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7,\ndoes not constitute binding precedent.\n2agreement; and (3) to whom the check would be paid. With no resolution of these issues\nin sight, Counsel moved to enforce the settlement.\nThe Magistrate Judge who handled the settlement conferences recommended to\nthe District Court that it grant the motion in part and deny it in part. App. 15a, 17a-18a\n(adopting Sanchez-Garcia v. United States, Civ. A. No. 17-5387, 2019 WL 1168311\n(E.D. Pa. Mar. 13, 2019)). The Magistrate Judge found that (1) the settlement agreement\nwas enforceable; and (2) Counsel\u2019s signature was not required. Sanchez-Garcia, 2019\nWL 1168311, at *3-4. He then recommended that (1) the United States pay its portion of\nthe settlement directly to Sanchez-Garcia; and (2) Sanchez-Garcia \u201csee that [Counsel] is\nproperly compensated in full compliance with the FTCA and with the fee agreement\nbetween herself and [C]ounsel.\u201d Id. at *4. The District Court adopted the Magistrate\nJudge\u2019s findings and recommendations over Counsel\u2019s objections. The United States\nthen sent Sanchez-Garcia a check for the settlement amount. A notice of appeal bearing\nSanchez-Garcia\u2019s name was filed.1\nII2\n1 Sanchez-Garcia filed a notice of appeal from the Magistrate Judge\u2019s order, but\nnot the District Court\u2019s subsequent order adopting the Report and Recommendation\n(\u201cR&R\u201d). Her failure to do so does not affect this appeal because we may treat her brief,\nwhich was filed within sixty days of the Court\u2019s order adopting the R&R, as a timely\nfiled notice of appeal. See Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 249 (1991) (holding that\nopening briefs may be treated as a notice of appeal); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B)(i)\n(allowing a notice of appeal to be filed within sixty days of an order or judgment when\nthe United States is a party).\n2 The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1). \u201cWe assess\nour own appellate jurisdiction in the first instance.\u201d Seneca Res. Corp. v. Township of\nHighland, 863 F.3d 245, 252 (3d Cir. 2017).\n3A\nBecause the issues raised in Sanchez-Garcia\u2019s brief concern Counsel, and not her,\nwe must first determine whether she has standing to pursue this appeal. \u201c[A]ny person\ninvoking the power of a federal court,\u201d Hollingsworth v. Perry, 570 U.S. 693, 704 (2013),\nincluding \u201cpersons seeking appellate review,\u201d Va. House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill,\n139 S. Ct. 1945, 1951 (2019) (quoting Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520\nU.S. 43, 64 (1997)), must demonstrate standing to do so,\u201d Hollingsworth, 570 U.S. at\n704. Thus, \u201can appealing litigant must demonstrate that [she] has suffered an actual or\nimminent injury that is \u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to the judgment below and that could be\n\u2018redress[ed] by a favorable ruling.\u2019\u201d Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 139 S. Ct.\n2356, 2362 (2019) (quoting Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 149-50\n(2010)). The appellant bears the burden of explaining how these elements are met.\nBethune-Hill, 139 S. Ct. at 1951.\nSanchez-Garcia lacks appellate standing for three reasons. First, Sanchez-Garcia\nhas not responded to the argument that she lacks standing, and thus, she has failed to\ncarry her burden. This failure alone supports dismissing the appeal. See id. (instructing\nthat \u201cwhen standing is questioned by . . . an opposing party, the litigant invoking the\ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d must explain why she has standing).\nSecond, Sanchez-Garcia has not been injured by the order enforcing the\nsettlement. On the contrary, she received her agreed-upon relief, and there is no redress\nwe can give her. Indeed, the brief makes clear that any alleged injuries arising from the\norder were sustained by Counsel, not by Sanchez-Garcia.\n4Third, except in limited circumstances, a litigant cannot rely on the injuries of\nothers to obtain Article III standing. Hollingsworth, 570 U.S. at 708. In those few\nsituations in which a litigant may assert the interests of others and thereby obtain third-\nparty standing, that litigant \u201cstill \u2018must have suffered an injury in fact,\u2019\u201d id. (quoting\nPowers v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 411 (1991)), and \u201chave consistent interests\u201d with the other\nparty, Amato v. Wilentz, 952 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir. 1991). Sanchez-Garcia does not\nsatisfy either requirement. As already stated, Sanchez-Garcia has suffered no injury from\nthe order enforcing the settlement. Moreover, even if she had suffered an injury from the\norder, she cannot show that she and Counsel \u201chave consistent interests.\u201d Amato, 952\nF.2d at 749. Indeed, their interests are not aligned because she already enjoys an\nenforceable settlement, while Counsel seeks to disturb the settlement to ensure he obtains\nhis fee.\nFor these reasons, Sanchez-Garcia lacks appellate standing.\nB\nWe lack jurisdiction to review this appeal for two additional reasons. First, where,\nas here, a party\u2019s attorney is the real party in interest, we will not review an appeal\nbrought in the client\u2019s name. Cf. Collier v. Marshall, Dennehey, Warner, Coleman &\nGoggin, 977 F.2d 93, 95 (3d Cir. 1992) (\u201c[W]hen sanctions are imposed only upon the\nattorney and the notice of appeal is in the name of the client alone, we are jurisdictionally\nbarred from considering an appeal of the order imposing sanctions against the attorney.\u201d);\nsee also Hollingsworth, 570 U.S. at 708 (stating the \u201cfundamental restriction on our\n5authority\u201d is that \u201ca litigant must assert his or her own legal rights and interests\u201d (quoting\nPowers, 499 U.S. at 410)).\nSecond, the notice of appeal fails to comply with Rule 3(c), which provides that\nthe notice of appeal must \u201cspecify the party or parties taking the appeal.\u201d This is a\njurisdictional requirement. Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Co., 487 U.S. 312, 314 (1988).\nThe appeal here asserts injuries sustained not by Sanchez-Garcia, but by Counsel. Thus,\nwhile Counsel\u2019s interests are at stake, his name is absent from the notice of appeal. As a\nresult, the notice of appeal is jurisdictionally deficient.\nIII\nFor the foregoing reasons, we will dismiss the appeal.\n6",

Following a three-day jury\ntrial, Mulkin was found guilty of the above-mentioned crimes on April 3, 2019.\nOn April 10, 2019, after considering a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report,\nthe trial court sentenced Mulkin to 18-36 months\u2019 imprisonment for\ninvoluntary manslaughter, an aggravated-range sentence,6 and imposed\nstandard-range sentences of 9-18 months\u2019 imprisonment for delivery of a\ndesigner drug7 and 9-18 months\u2019 imprisonment for criminal use of a\ncommunication facility. The trial court stated on the record that an\naggravated-range sentence on the involuntary manslaughter count was\njustified because Mulkin delivered drugs he knew to have recently caused\nothers to overdose,8 and because Mulkin had previously been caught with\ncontrolled substances while incarcerated for drug possession.\n____________________________________________\n5 Furanylfentanyl is a derivative of the synthetic opioid, Fentanyl. N.T. Trial,\n6/20/19, at 200-23. Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine,\nand furanylfentanyl is slightly less potent than Fentanyl. Id.\n6 With an offense gravity score (OGS) of 6 for involuntary manslaughter and\nMulkin\u2019s prior record score (PRS) of 0, the standard-range minimum sentence\nat that count was 3-12 months\u2019 imprisonment, and the aggravated range\nminimum was 18 months\u2019 imprisonment. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a).\n7 For sentencing purposes, Mulkin\u2019s conviction for delivery of a controlled\nsubstance merged delivery of a designer drug.\n8 In May of 2016, Mulkin purchased several baggies of furanylfentanyl, which\nhe thought contained heroin, for himself and Whitesell. N.T. Trial, 4/1/19 at\n121-22. At the time of purchase, Mulkin was told that other drug users had\nrecently overdosed after ingesting that particular batch of drugs. Id. at 121.\n- 2 -J-S68026-19\nOn April 18, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely motion to modify sentence which\nthe trial court denied on May 2, 2019. On May 11, 2019, Mulkin filed a timely\nnotice of appeal followed by a court-ordered Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) concise\nstatement of errors complained of on appeal. He presents the following issue\nfor our consideration: \u201cDid the [s]entencing [c]ourt abuse [its] discretion by\nrelying on inappropriate factors and by ignoring mitigating evidence when it\naggravated [Mulkin\u2019s] sentence beyond the standard range?\u201d Brief for\nAppellant, at 5.\nMulkin\u2019s claim represents a challenge to the discretionary aspects of his\nsentence. Commonwealth v. Prestidge, 539 A.2d 439, 441 (Pa. Super.\n1988). An appeal raising the discretionary aspects of sentencing is not\nguaranteed as of right; rather, it is considered a petition for permission to\nappeal. Commonwealth v. Williams, 562 A.2d 1385, 1386-87 (Pa. Super.\n1989) (en banc). In order to reach the merits of a discretionary aspects claim,\nwe must engage in a four-part analysis to determine:\n(1) whether appellant has filed a timely notice of appeal, see\nPa.R.A.P. 902 and 903; (2) whether the issue was properly\npreserved at sentencing or in a motion to reconsider and modify\nsentence, see Pa.R.Crim.P. [720]; (3) whether appellant\u2019s brief\nhas a fatal defect, Pa.R.A.P. 2119(f); and (4) whether there is a\nsubstantial question that the sentence appealed from is not\nappropriate under the Sentencing Code.\n* * *\n____________________________________________\nAccordingly, Mulkin advised Whitesell upon delivering the drugs not to inject\nthem intravenously \u201cbecause [he] was told that it was a potent batch of\nheroin.\u201d Id. at 124.\n- 3 -J-S68026-19\nThe determination of what constitutes a substantial question must\nbe evaluated on a case-by-case basis. A substantial question\nexists only when the appellant advances a colorable argument\nthat the sentencing judge\u2019s actions were either: (1) inconsistent\nwith a specific provision of the Sentencing Code; or (2) contrary\nto the fundamental norms which underlie the sentencing process.\nCommonwealth v. Griffin, 65 A.3d 932, 935-36 (Pa. Super. 2013) (citations\nand quotations omitted).\nHere, Mulkin filed a post-sentence motion to modify his sentence, a\ntimely notice of appeal, and included in his brief a concise statement of\nreasons relied upon for appeal pursuant to Rule 2119(f). Additionally, Mulkin\nraises a substantial question by asserting the sentencing court relied on an\nimpermissible factor and ignored mitigating evidence when imposing an\naggravated-range sentence for involuntary manslaughter. See\nCommonwealth v. Roden, 730 A.2d 995 (Pa. Super. 1999) (sentencing\ncourt relying on impermissible factor raises substantial question); see also\nCommonwealth v. Felmlee, 828 A.2d 1105, 1107 (Pa. Super. 2003)\n(imposition of aggravated-range sentence without considering mitigating\nfactors raises substantial question).\nWe, therefore, address Mulkin\u2019s claim, which raises two arguments:\nfirst, that the court erred by relying on an impermissible factor, and second,\nthat the court erred by ignoring mitigating evidence.9\n____________________________________________\n9 Mulkin contends that the court failed to consider, inter alia, (1) positive\ncharacter references from his mother, former employer, and lifelong family\nfriend; (2) that he graduated from high school; (3) his strong work ethic; (4)\nhis sincere remorse; and (5) that his criminal history is limited to non-violent\ndrug offenses. See Brief of Appellant, at 14-17.\n- 4 -J-S68026-19\nWe note that when imposing sentence, the trial court is granted broad\ndiscretion, as it is in the best position to determine the proper penalty for a\nparticular offense based upon an evaluation of the individual circumstances\nbefore it. Commonwealth v. Walls, 926 A.2d 957, 961 (Pa. 2017). We are\nalso cognizant of the fact that the trial court considered a PSI before imposing\nMulkin\u2019s sentence. Commonwealth v. Ventura, 975 A.2d 1128, 1135 (Pa.\nSuper. 2009) (sentencing court informed by PSI presumed aware of relevant\nfactors).\nMulkin\u2019s first argument is waived, as he fails to reference any legal\nauthority for the proposition that the sentencing court abused its discretion by\nimpermissibly relying on his drug-related prison infraction while incarcerated\non unrelated drug possession charges as a reason to aggravate his sentence.\nBrief of Appellant, at 13; see Pa.R.A.P. 2119(b) (party must direct court\u2019s\nattention to specific authority relied upon); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 985\nA.2d 915, 924 (Pa. 2009) (\u201c[W]here an appellate brief fails to provide any\ndiscussion of a claim with citation to relevant authority or fails to develop the\nissue in any meaningful fashion capable of review, that claim is waived.\u201d).\nWe, therefore, consider only the portion of Mulkin\u2019s claim relating to the\nsentencing court\u2019s alleged failure to \u201cconsider the mitigating evidence\npresented at the sentencing hearing.\u201d Brief of Appellant, at 12.\nWe have repeatedly held that where a sentencing court has the benefit\nof a PSI, the court is presumed to have weighed all relevant information\nregarding the defendant\u2019s character against any mitigating factors.\n- 5 -J-S68026-19\nCommonwealth v. Moury, 992 A.2d 162, 171 (Pa. Super. 2010). As the\nsentencing judge considered a PSI before imposing sentence, Mulkin\u2019s\nargument that the court ignored mitigating evidence is without merit.\nMoreover, this argument is belied by the record, as the sentencing judge noted\nafter hearing all of the mitigating evidence that Mulkin had been a \u201cgood young\nm[a]n\u201d before his involvement with drugs. N.T. Sentencing, 4/10/19, at 35.\nIt is well-settled that where \u201cthe sentencing court proffers reasons\nindicating that its decision to depart from the guidelines is not unreasonable,\nthe sentence will be upheld.\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 863 A.2d 1172,\n1177-78 (Pa. Super. 2004). See Commonwealth v. Walls, 926 A.2d 957\n(Pa. 2007) (noting difficulty of defining inquiry into reasonableness of\nsentence). Based on the record, we cannot conclude that Mulkin\u2019s sentence\nis manifestly unreasonable. The sentencing court proffered sufficient reasons\nindicating why it decided to sentence Mulkin in the aggravated range on the\ninvoluntary manslaughter count.\nWe, however, sua sponte examine the legality of Mulkin\u2019s sentence with\nrespect to the court\u2019s decision to determine the amount and method of\npayment of restitution at a later date. See Commonwealth v. Ramos, 197\nA.3d 766, 768-69 (Pa. Super. 2018) (court\u2019s authority to impose restitution\nimplicates legality of sentence); Commonwealth v. Infante, 63 A.3d 358,\n363 (Pa. Super. 2013) (this Court may consider legality of sentence sua\nsponte). A challenge to the legality of sentence raises a question of law.\nCommonwealth v. Smith, 956 A.2d 1029, 1033 (Pa. Super. 2008) (en\n- 6 -J-S68026-19\nbanc). Our standard of review, therefore, is de novo and the scope of our\nreview is plenary. Commonwealth v. Childs, 63 A.3d 323, 325 (Pa. Super.\n2013).\nAt Mulkin\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court ordered Mulkin to \u201cpay the\ncosts of court [sic] as determined in a separate hearing.\u201d N.T. Sentencing,\n4/10/19, at 39. In a supplemental Rule 1925(a) opinion, the sentencing judge\nnoted:\nRight before sentencing, the Commonwealth filed for a large\namount of costs and restitution and furnished a large packet of\ndocuments relating to those claims. Much of the amount claimed\nrelated to expert witness costs and fees. The [c]ourt erroneously,\nand without objection from either party, decided to set a separate\nrestitution hearing[10] due to the complexity and amount of\nrestitution claimed and inability of the defense to then evaluate\nand contest the amounts claimed. In view of [Commonwealth]\nv. Gentry, 101 A.3d 813 (Pa. Super. 2014)[,] and\n[Commonwealth] v. Mariani, 869 A.2d 484 (Pa. Super.\n2005)[,] this was error at least [as] to the restitution claims of the\nvictims. A restitution hearing was originally scheduled for May\n14[, 2019], but was continued to June 11, at the request of the\nCommonwealth. Upon realizing its error, it was the intention of\nthis court to vacate the original sentence and deal with the\nrestitution claims before entering an appropriate final sentencing\norder. In the meantime, the defense appealed the original\nsentence on other grounds on May 11, 2019, such that this court\ncould no longer correct the situation.\nSupplemental 1925(a) Opinion, 9/11/19, at 1.\nAs the above-referenced statement indicates, the court conflated\nrestitution, fines, and costs of prosecution, delayed a hearing resolving each\n____________________________________________\n10 On April 17, 2019, the court ordered a hearing on \u201crestitution, fines and\ncosts\u201d to be held on May 14, 2019. Trial Court Order, 4/17/19, at 1.\n- 7 -J-S68026-19\nof these penalties until after sentencing, and was divested of jurisdiction\nbefore reaching a resolution. Id.; see also Commonwealth v. Klein, 781\nA.2d 1133, 1135 (Pa. 2001) (except in limited circumstances, filing notice of\nappeal divests trial court of jurisdiction). We appreciate the court bringing\nthis to our attention. We will, first, delineate among restitution, costs, and\nfines, and second, clarify the requirement that restitution be determined at\nsentencing.\nIn brief, the Crimes Code provides for restitution as a direct sentence,\nwhile portions of the Sentencing Code allow it as a condition of probation or\nintermediate punishment. Commononwealth v. Harriott, 919 A.2d 234,\n238 (Pa. Super. 2007); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9754(c)(8) (authorizing restitution as a\ncondition of probation); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763(b)(10) (authorizing restitution as\na condition attached to intermediate punishment); 204 Pa.Code \u00a7\n303.14(c)(2) (restitution may be imposed as a direct sentence or as a\ncondition of probation or intermediate punishment). Fines are also a\ncomponent of a defendant\u2019s sentence; costs, on the other hand, are always\nincidental to judgment. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721 (sentencing alternatives\ninclude fines); Commonwealth v. Soudani, 165 A.2d 709, 711 (Pa. Super.\n1960) (direction to pay costs in criminal proceeding not part of sentence).\nSection 1106 of the Crimes Code governs the imposition of restitution\nas a direct sentence, providing, in relevant part, as follows:\n(2) At the time of sentencing the court shall specify the amount\nand method of restitution. In determining the amount and\nmethod of restitution, the court:\n- 8 -J-S68026-19\n(i) Shall consider the extent of the injury suffered by\nthe victim, the victim\u2019s request for restitution as\npresented to the district attorney in accordance with\nparagraph (4) and such other matters as it deems\nappropriate.\n* * *\n(4) (i) It shall be the responsibility of the district attorneys of the\nrespective counties to make a recommendation to the court at or\nprior to the time of sentencing as to the amount of restitution to\nbe ordered. This recommendation shall be based upon\ninformation solicited by the district attorney and received from the\nvictim.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1106(c) (emphasis added). We note that under Pennsylvania\nlaw, \u201can order of restitution to be determined later is ipso facto illegal.\u201d\nMariani, supra at 487.\nSection 9721(a) of the Sentencing Code sets forth a trial court\u2019s\nsentencing alternatives; a fine is one of those alternatives. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\n9721(a)(5). Fines may either be imposed as a defendant\u2019s sole sentence or\nas an additional sentence when the defendant has derived a pecuniary gain\nfrom the crime or the court opines that a fine is \u201cspecially adapted to\ndeterrence of the crime involved or to the correction of the defendant.\u201d 42\nPa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(a), (b)(1)-(2). A court shall not sentence a defendant to pay\na fine unless the record demonstrates that: \u201c(1) the defendant is or will be\nable to pay fine; and (2) the fine will not prevent the defendant from making\nrestitution\u201d to the victim. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(c).\n- 9 -J-S68026-19\nIn addition to the sentencing alternatives under section 9721(a), the\nSentencing Code provides for mandatory restitution to the victim11 and\nmandatory payment of costs.12 Unlike restitution imposed under 42 Pa.C.S.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1106, 9721(c), and unlike fines, which are both part of a defendant\u2019s\nsentence, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9726(a), (b)(1)-(2), \u201ca direction to pay costs in a\ncriminal proceeding is not part of the sentence, but is an incident of the\njudgment. Costs do not form a part of the penalty imposed by the statutes\nproviding for the punishment of criminal offenses[.]\u201d Soudani, supra at 711.\nFurthermore, a court order is not required for a defendant to incur liability for\ncosts under section 9721. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(c.1). \u201cIn the event the\ncourt fails to issue an order for costs pursuant to section 9728, costs shall be\nimposed upon the defendant under this section.\u201d Id. If, however, the trial\ncourt determines, after a hearing, that the defendant is unable to pay costs\nimmediately, the trial court has authority under Pa.R.Crim.P. 706 to determine\nthe amount and method of payment. Pa.R.Crim.P. 706(a)-(c). The trial court\nmay also provide that a defendant shall not be liable for costs under Rule 706.\nCommonwealth v. Childs, 63 A.3d 323, 326 (Pa. Super. 2013).\nInstantly, the Commonwealth provided a preliminary assessment of\ncosts and restitution at sentencing, explaining: \u201cjust as a starting point it\nappears that as far as the costs of prosecution it is $21,288.19 and then there\n____________________________________________\n11 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(c).\n12 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(c.1).\n- 10 -J-S68026-19\nis restitution of $3,125 for funeral costs and there is also some outstanding\ncounseling fees to [Whitesell\u2019s wife] that we don\u2019t have final bills on at this\npoint.\u201d N.T. Sentencing, 4/10/19, at 2. On April 17, 2019, the court ordered\na hearing on \u201crestitution, fines and costs\u201d to be held at a later date.\nHere, \u201cthe court\u2019s order at the initial sentencing, postponing the\nimposition of restitution until a later date, [fails] to meet the criteria of the\nrestitution statute and taints the entire sentence.\u201d Commonwealth v.\nMuhammed, 219 A.3d 1207, 1215 (Pa. Super. 2019) (quoting Ramos,\nsupra at 770). Accordingly, the sentencing order is illegal, the entire\nsentence must be vacated, and this matter must be remanded for\nresentencing. See Ramos, supra at 770-71; Muhammed, supra at 1213.\nDuring resentencing, the trial court shall determine what, if any,\nrestitution is owed pursuant to section 1106. Muhammed, supra at 1213;\n18 Pa.C.S. 1106(c)(3). If any fines are owed, they must be imposed at\nsentencing as well.\nJudgment of sentence vacated.

We will affirm a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of\n2Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 3 of 8\nacquittal if a reasonable jury could conclude that the evidence establishes the\ndefendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.\nWe review constitutional challenges to a defendant\u2019s sentence de novo.\nUnited States v. Bowers, 811 F.3d 412, 430 (11th Cir. 2016). We review the\ndistrict court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and will \u201cnot disturb the district\ncourt\u2019s finding of fact unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake\nhas been made.\u201d United States v. Maddox, 803 F.3d 1215, 1220 (11th Cir. 2015)\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\nII\nWe readily reject Mathis\u2019s argument that the evidence was insufficient to\nconvict him. Even a short recitation of some evidence against him is enough to\nconclude that a reasonable jury could find him guilty of both crimes of conviction\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\nFirst, we consider his conspiracy conviction. To prove a conspiracy to\ndistribute narcotics, the government must show \u201cthat 1) an agreement existed\nbetween two or more persons to distribute the drugs; 2) that the defendant at issue\nknew of the conspiratorial goal; and 3) that he knowingly joined or participated in\nthe illegal venture.\u201d United States v. Matthews, 168 F.3d 1234, 1245 (11th Cir.\n1999). The government establishes proof of a single conspiracy when it shows that\nthe defendant either facilitated the actions of co-conspirators or the venture as a\n3Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 4 of 8\nwhole. United States v. Chandler, 388 F.3d 796, 811\u201312 (11th Cir. 2004). The\ngovernment may prove the existence of a conspiracy through circumstantial\nevidence, including inferences from the conduct of alleged participants. United\nStates v. Silvestri, 409 F.3d 1311, 1328 (11th Cir. 2005).\nHere, the government presented ample evidence for a reasonable jury to\nconvict Mathis of conspiracy. Walter Williams testified that Mathis routinely\npurchased methamphetamine from him in increasingly large quantities. This was\ncorroborated by evidence\u2014from a roving wiretap targeting Williams\u2014of\nnumerous texts and calls indicating drug transactions between Williams and\nMathis. Williams testified that when Mathis got in trouble and was required to\nwear an ankle monitor, he would send his girlfriend, Elizabeth Gallaher, to pick up\nthe drugs. Moreover, Dana Stokes and Ashley Shaw both testified that Mathis\npurchased large quantities of methamphetamine from Williams and worked with\nothers to distribute it. Williams, Shaw, and Stokes, each identified purchases or\nsales of methamphetamines by Mathis that jury could reasonably conclude\namounted to participation or facilitation of the conspiracy.\nAdditionally, three large quantities of methamphetamine seized in the course\nof the investigation had a nexus to Mathis. First, a significant quantity of\nmethamphetamine and a firearm were found in the car of Elizabeth Gallaher, with\ntext messages from the wiretap and phone call recordings from the jail indicating\n4Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 5 of 8\nthat Gallaher was transporting the methamphetamine at the direction of Mathis.\nSecond, a Pringles can filled with methamphetamine was seized from a home\nwhere Mathis\u2019s truck was parked and where a man generally matching Mathis\u2019s\ndescription was seen fleeing at the time of the police raid. And finally, a bag of\nmethamphetamine, a firearm, and a scale were seized from a backpack Mathis was\nseen wearing. All of this evidence was more than sufficient to sustain the jury\u2019s\nverdict on the conspiracy charge.1\nMathis\u2019s possession with intent to distribute conviction is also supported by\nample evidence. To support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute\nunder 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the government must prove three elements: (1)\nknowledge, (2) possession, and (3) intent to distribute. United States v. Poole, 878\nF.2d 1389, 1391 (11th Cir. 1989). Possession may be actual or constructive, and if\nthe defendant \u201cexercised some measure of dominion or control over the\ncontraband,\u201d regardless of whether this control was shared with others, the\n1 Mathis suggests that we should only consider the methamphetamine found in Gallaher\u2019s car\nbecause he was acquitted of the possession charges stemming from the other seizures. This is\nincorrect. The Supreme Court has explained that sufficiency-of-the-evidence review is\n\u201cindependent of the jury\u2019s determination that evidence on another count was insufficient.\u201d\nUnited States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 67 (1984). And in the RICO context, we have held that\n\u201cneither the acquittal of appellants nor their codefendants on other counts alleging similar or\nrelated conduct is relevant to the issue of whether sufficient evidence supports appellants\u2019 RICO\nconspiracy convictions.\u201d United States v. Shenberg, 89 F.3d 1461, 1470 (11th Cir. 1996); see\nalso United States v. Munoz, 430 F.3d 1357, 1366 n.8 (11th Cir. 2005) (A \u201cdefendant can be\nconvicted of conspiracy but acquitted of the substantive crimes.\u201d). In any event, even if Mathis\nwere correct, substantial evidence still supports his convictions and it would not change our\nresult.\n5Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 6 of 8\ndefendant constructively possessed it. United States v. Pantoja-Soto, 739 F.2d\n1520, 1525 (11th Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, the\nintent to distribute may be inferred from the quantity of contraband seized. United\nStates v. Iglesias, 915 F.2d 1524, 1528 (11th Cir. 1990). \u201cIn proving that a\ndefendant aided and abetted possession of a controlled substance with intent to\ndistribute, the government must introduce evidence connecting defendant with\nboth aspects of the crime, possession and intent to distribute.\u201d Pantoja-Soto, 739\nF.2d at 1525 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nThe government provided numerous texts, calls, and testimony to show that\nGallaher\u2019s possession of the methamphetamine on October 8, 2016 was pursuant to\nan arrangement between Williams and Mathis. Williams testified that he would\n\u201cfront\u201d distribution quantities of methamphetamine to Mathis who would repay\nhim later. He testified that when Mathis was unable to meet due to his ankle\nmonitor, he would send Gallaher to pick up the drugs instead. When the large\nquantity of methamphetamine (664.2 grams) was found in Gallaher\u2019s vehicle\nfollowing a traffic stop, contemporaneous phone calls between Williams and\nMathis\u2014captured on the wiretap\u2014suggested that her activity was coordinated by\nthe two men. And finally, the day after Gallaher\u2019s arrest, a recorded jail phone call\ndemonstrated that Mathis was directing Gallaher. When Gallaher said \u201cI put\nmyself into this position,\u201d Mathis responded: \u201cYou didn\u2019t. I did.\u201d And later in the\n6Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 7 of 8\nsame call, when Gallaher said that she was \u201csorry,\u201d Mathis responded \u201c. . .for\nwhat? Doing what I asked you too?\u201d All of this evidence was more than sufficient\nfor a reasonably jury to conclude that Mathis aided and abetted Gallaher\u2019s\npossession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute.\nIII\nWe also reject the challenge to Mathis\u2019s sentence. Mathis argues that the\ndistrict court improperly considered acquitted conduct when it found, for\nsentencing purposes, that he possessed a firearm. He makes two alternative\narguments on this point. First, he argues that because the jury acquitted him of the\npossession of a firearm and the related drug offense, the district court improperly\nconsidered the firearm at sentencing. Second, he argues\u2014in a single sentence with\nno elaboration\u2014that the \u201ctrial court erred in finding, by preponderance of the\nevidence, that Mr. Mathis possessed a firearm.\u201d\nWe can reject his first argument based on clear precedent. \u201cIt is well\nsettled . . . that the sentencing court may consider any fact for which a defendant\nhas been acquitted as long as the Government proves, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, the occurrence of that conduct and as long as the enhancement results in\na sentence below the maximum statutory penalty authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d\nMaddox, 803 F.3d at 1220. Because the district court found that the government\nproved the possession of a firearm by a preponderance of the evidence, and\n7Case: 18-14125 Date Filed: 02/10/2020 Page: 8 of 8\nbecause it sentenced him to a statutorily authorized penalty, it properly applied the\nU.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement.\nWe can also easily dispose of his second point. When reviewing the\napplication of a sentencing enhancement, we will \u201cnot disturb the district court\u2019s\nfinding of fact unless we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\nbeen made.\u201d Maddox, 803 F.3d at 1220 (internal quotation marks omitted). We\nhave no such conviction here. It was not clear error for the district court to\nconclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Mathis possessed the firearm.\nTestimony established that two officers saw Mathis wearing a backpack, followed\nhim to a house, arrested him, and discovered a pistol and methamphetamine inside\nthe backpack.\nAFFIRMED.\n8",

Hon. Courtnie Tucker, Magistrate.\nJudgment terminating parental rights, affirmed.\nAaron Bazzoli, Canyon County Public Defender; Scott J. Davis, Deputy Public\nDefender, Caldwell, for appellant.\nHon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Kathryn T. Garrett, Deputy\nAttorney General, Caldwell, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nLORELLO, Judge\nJane Doe (2019-31) appeals from a judgment terminating her parental rights. We affirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nDoe is the mother of a child born in 2011. The child was placed in shelter care after\npolice received a report of parental substance abuse and the child being left without a caregiver.\nThe magistrate court awarded legal custody of the child to the Idaho Department of Health and\nWelfare and approved a case plan for Doe in November 2017. The child was placed with Doe\u2019s\n1brother and his wife. In March 2018, Doe\u2019s brother and his wife moved to New York and the\nmagistrate court approved an out-of-state placement with them. Ultimately, the Department filed\na petition to terminate Doe\u2019s parental rights. Following trial, the magistrate court terminated\nDoe\u2019s parental rights after finding clear and convincing evidence that Doe had neglected the\nchild and termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. Doe appeals.\nII.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nOn appeal from a decision terminating parental rights, this Court examines whether the\ndecision is supported by substantial and competent evidence, which means such evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243,\n245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009). The appellate court will indulge all reasonable\ninferences in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment when reviewing an order that parental rights\nbe terminated. Id. The Idaho Supreme Court has also said that the substantial evidence test\nrequires a greater quantum of evidence in cases where the trial court\u2019s finding must be supported\nby clear and convincing evidence than in cases where a mere preponderance is required. Doe v.\nDoe, 143 Idaho 343, 346, 144 P.3d 597, 600 (2006). Clear and convincing evidence is generally\nunderstood to be evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably\ncertain. In re Doe, 143 Idaho 188, 191, 141 P.3d 1057, 1060 (2006). Further, the trial court\u2019s\ndecision must be supported by objectively supportable grounds. Doe, 143 Idaho at 346, 144 P.3d\nat 600.\nIII.\nANALYSIS\nDoe raises two issues on appeal. First, Doe contends that it was impossible for her to\ncomplete her case plan due to the child\u2019s removal from the state and placement in New York.\nSecond, Doe contends that the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts should be examined on appeal,\nand the lack of reasonable efforts should be a defense to termination notwithstanding the absence\nof such a requirement in the statute governing termination. We affirm the decision of the\nmagistrate court terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights.\n2A. Reviewability of Reasonable Efforts\nWe first address Doe\u2019s arguments regarding the reviewability of the Department\u2019s\nreasonable efforts at reunification. Doe contends that, in Idaho, termination of parental rights\nmay occur even if the Department has made no reasonable efforts at reunification. Doe argues\nthis alleged defect potentially jeopardizes federal funding for Idaho\u2019s foster care system. Finally,\nDoe asserts \u201cthere is no way to review\u201d a finding that the Department has made reasonable\nefforts other than on a \u201climited basis\u201d during the child protection case. Doe argues that due\nprocess requires \u201cmore.\u201d We disagree.\nDoe\u2019s contention that parental rights may be terminated without any reasonable efforts is\nnot supported by law. The Child Protective Act requires reasonable efforts. A petition for\nremoval from the home must state that reasonable efforts were made to prevent removal from the\nhome or that reasonable efforts to prevent placement were not required due to aggravated\ncircumstances. I.C. \u00a7 16-1610(2)(i)(iii). Once a child is taken into shelter care, the magistrate\ncourt must conduct a hearing and make a determination regarding the Department\u2019s reasonable\nefforts. I.C. \u00a7 16-1615(5)(b). The magistrate court must also make findings regarding\nreasonable efforts at the adjudicatory hearing in order to vest custody in the Department. I.C.\n\u00a7 16-1619(6). These findings include whether the Department made reasonable efforts to\nprevent placement of the child in foster care. Id. If the child is placed in the Department\u2019s\ncustody, the Department must prepare a case plan that sets forth reasonable efforts that will be\nmade to make it possible for the child to return home. I.C. \u00a7 16-1621(3). The case plan must be\napproved by the court and, after approval, the plan is entered as a court order that includes a\nrequirement that reasonable efforts be made to reunify in a timely manner in accordance with the\ncase plan. I.C. \u00a7 16-1621(5). The case plan is then subject to review every six months. I.C.\n\u00a7 16-1622(1). One purpose of the review hearings is to assess permanency. I.C. \u00a7 16-1622. A\npermanency hearing must be held no later than twelve months from removal or from the order\nplacing jurisdiction in the Department, whichever occurs first, at which the court must approve,\nreject, or modify the permanency plan and review progress in accomplishing the permanency\ngoal. I.C. \u00a7 16-1622(2)(b). In this context, the court is required to make written, case-specific\nfindings whether the Department made reasonable efforts to finalize the primary permanency\ngoal in effect for the child. I.C. \u00a7 16-1622(2)(c). A lack of reasonable efforts to reunify may be\n3a basis for an order approving a permanency plan with the goal of reunification. Id. Once the\nchild has been in the temporary or legal custody of the Department for fifteen of the most recent\ntwenty-two months, the Department shall file a petition to terminate parental rights. I.C.\n\u00a7 16-1622(2)(g). There are exceptions to this requirement, including where the Department has\nfailed to provide reasonable efforts to reunify the child with his or her family. I.C.\n\u00a7 16-1622(2)(g)(iii). In short, reasonable efforts are an ongoing consideration throughout the\nchild protection case.1\nAlthough Doe contends that Idaho\u2019s treatment of the federal reasonable efforts\nrequirement \u201carguably\u201d jeopardizes federal subsidies for foster care, she does not present any\nargument explaining why such funding could be at risk and her reference to 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21\ndoes not support her assertion. The applicable federal regulation only conditions foster care\nfunding in an individual case on a judicial determination that reasonable efforts were made to\nprevent removal and finalize the permanency plan. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 1356.21(b) (2012); see also\n42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 671 (2019). As described above, the requirements attendant to the child\nprotection proceedings include reasonable efforts throughout.2\nThe Department\u2019s reasonable efforts, and a magistrate court\u2019s findings regarding\nreasonable efforts, are subject to appellate review. There is a statutory right to appeal at several\npoints during the pendency of the child protection proceeding. I.C. \u00a7 16-1625(1). An aggrieved\nparent may appeal an adjudicatory decree, any order subsequent to the adjudicatory decree that\nvests legal custody in the Department, and any order subsequent to the adjudicatory decree that\nauthorizes or mandates the Department to cease reasonable efforts. Id. Although Doe\nacknowledges that review of reasonable efforts is provided for in the child protection case\npursuant to I.C. \u00a7 16-1625(1), she does not explain why this review does not satisfy due process.\nIt appears Doe\u2019s argument is instead premised on a preference for review of reasonable efforts\n1 The record in this case reflects that the magistrate court made the requisite finding\nregarding the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts throughout the child protection case. Moreover,\nthe magistrate court denied the Department\u2019s motion to cease reasonable efforts.\n2 The exception for cases involving aggravated circumstances does not apply in Doe\u2019s\ncase. Moreover, federal law also contains an aggravated circumstances exception to reasonable\nefforts. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(D)(i) (2019); 45 CFR \u00a7 1356.21(b)(3)(i) (2012).\n4following termination rather than from the appealable orders entered following proceedings\nduring the child protection case in which reasonable efforts are required. This preference does\nnot, however, implicate due process. Moreover, it is contrary to the statutory scheme enacted by\nthe legislature.\nThere may be important policy reasons that the legislature provided for statutory\nappellate review of reasonable efforts in the child protection case and did not include reasonable\nefforts as a required finding once a termination petition has been filed. Such considerations may\ninclude concerns for permanency and stability for the child. See I.C. \u00a7 16-1622(2)(g) (requiring\nthe Department to file a petition to terminate parental rights once the child has been in the\ntemporary or legal custody of the Department for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 671(a)(15)(C) (2019) (providing that, if continuation of reasonable efforts at\nreunification is inconsistent with the permanency plan for the child, reasonable efforts should be\nmade to place the child in accordance with the permanency plan and complete whatever steps are\nnecessary to finalize permanent placement). Whatever the policy considerations may be, such\nchoices are within the purview of the legislature, not the judiciary.3 See Idaho State AFL-CIO v.\nLeroy, 110 Idaho 691, 698, 718 P.2d 1129, 1136 (1986) (stating that, in the absence of a\nlegislative invasion of constitutionally protected rights, the judicial branch of government must\nrespect and defer to the legislature\u2019s exclusive policy decisions).\nIt is well-settled that the Department\u2019s efforts at reunification are not relevant to the\nmagistrate court\u2019s termination decision under I.C. \u00a7 16-2005. The Idaho Supreme Court recently\nreaffirmed this principle in In re Doe, 164 Idaho 883, 889, 436 P.3d 1232, 1238 (2019) and\nrejected an assertion, similar to Doe\u2019s, that this principle violates due process. Id. at 889-90, 436\nP.3d at 1238-39. Doe has failed to identify any due process flaw in when or how the\nDepartment\u2019s reasonable efforts are considered and reviewed in Idaho.\n3 The legislature is also the proper forum for presenting testimony regarding considerations\nrelevant to when and how reasonable efforts should be reviewed during the course of the child\nprotection case, including what actions should or should not be taken in the case during the\npendency of any appellate review.\n5B. Termination\n1. Statutory basis\nDoe argues that moving her child out of state made it impossible for her to complete\n\u201cimportant and significant portions\u201d of her case plan making it improper to terminate her\nparental rights for failure to do so. We hold that the magistrate court\u2019s determination that Doe\nneglected her child was supported by clear and convincing evidence.\nA parent has a fundamental liberty interest in maintaining a relationship with his or her\nchild. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000); Doe v. State, 137 Idaho 758, 760, 53 P.3d\n341, 343 (2002). This interest is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution. State v. Doe, 144 Idaho 839, 842, 172 P.3d 1114, 1117 (2007). Implicit in the\nTermination of Parent and Child Relationship Act is the philosophy that, wherever possible,\nfamily life should be strengthened and preserved. I.C. \u00a7 16-2001(2). Therefore, the requisites of\ndue process must be met when terminating the parent-child relationship. State v. Doe, 143 Idaho\n383, 386, 146 P.3d 649, 652 (2006). Due process requires that the grounds for terminating a\nparent-child relationship be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Id. Because a\nfundamental liberty interest is at stake, the United States Supreme Court has determined that a\ncourt may terminate a parent-child relationship only if that decision is supported by clear and\nconvincing evidence. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982); see also I.C. \u00a7 16-2009;\nIn re Doe, 146 Idaho 759, 761-62, 203 P.3d 689, 691-92 (2009); Doe, 143 Idaho at 386, 146 P.3d\nat 652. Idaho Code Section 16-2005 permits a party to petition the court for termination of the\nparent-child relationship when it is in the child\u2019s best interests and any one of the following five\nfactors exist: (a) abandonment; (b) neglect or abuse; (c) lack of a biological relationship between\nthe child and a presumptive parent; (d) the parent is unable to discharge parental responsibilities\nfor a prolonged period that will be injurious to the health, morals, or well-being of the child; or\n(e) the parent is incarcerated and will remain incarcerated for a substantial period of time. Each\nstatutory ground is an independent basis for termination. Doe, 144 Idaho at 842, 172 P.3d at\n1117.\nIdaho Code Section 16-1602(31)(a) provides, in pertinent part, that a child is neglected\nwhen the child is without proper parental care and control, or subsistence, medical or other care\nor control necessary for his or her well-being because of the conduct or omission of his or her\n6parents, guardian, or other custodian or their neglect or refusal to provide them. Neglect also\nexists where the parent has failed to comply with the court\u2019s orders or the case plan in a Child\nProtective Act case and the Department has had temporary or legal custody of the child for\nfifteen of the most recent twenty-two months and reunification has not been accomplished by the\nlast day of the fifteenth month in which the child has been in the temporary or legal custody of\nthe Department. I.C. \u00a7 16-2002(3)(b).\nDoe\u2019s case plan required her to: (1) complete a substance abuse screening and follow all\nrecommendations; (2) complete a mental health assessment and comply with all\nrecommendations made by the mental health provider; (3) complete a parenting course to learn\nnew skills and develop her role as a caretaker; (4) participate in a healthy relationships class or\ngroup and demonstrate the skills learned in caring for the child and interacting with others;\n(5) participate in regular visits with the child to continue creating healthy attachments and\ndemonstrate her ability to implement the techniques learned in parenting classes; (6) demonstrate\nthe ability to provide and care for the child\u2019s basic, developmental, medical, and other needs as\nthey arise; and (7) maintain stable housing for 120 consecutive days and provide proof of stable\nhousing to the Department. The magistrate court found that during the nearly two-year period\nthat the child was in foster care, Doe failed to \u201ccomplete the tasks in her case plan that would\nallow the safe return of her child to her care.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the magistrate court\nfound that communication with Doe was difficult throughout the child protection action; Doe\n\u201cdeflected issues that needed to be addressed and placed blame on others for the issues that\nprevented [the child] from safely returning to her care\u201d; Doe failed to establish safe and stable\nhousing; Doe\u2019s mental health issues remained unaddressed; Doe did not avail herself of the\nopportunity to learn about healthy relationships; Doe\u2019s visitations with the child were\ninconsistent and Doe\u2019s hostility toward the foster mother negatively impacted her visitations; and\nDoe did not overcome her substance abuse issues despite having nineteen months to do so. With\nrespect to Doe\u2019s substance abuse, the magistrate court noted that Doe continued to test positive\nfor controlled substance during the child protection case and was not forthright about her\nsubstance abuse issues.\nThe magistrate court also found clear and convincing evidence that Doe did not exercise\nproper parental care and control over her child. Doe did not provide subsistence, education,\n7medical, or other care and control necessary for the child\u2019s well-being. Finally, the magistrate\ncourt found that, other than sending the child a box of toys, Doe did not provide consistent\nsupport for the child while she was in foster care.\nDoe asserts that the magistrate court erred in finding that she neglected the child by\nfailing to complete the case plan because it was impossible for her to complete two of the tasks\nin the case plan once the child was placed out of state. Specifically, Doe argues that her efforts\nto accomplish two \u201cimportant tasks\u201d in her case plan \u201cwere utterly frustrated\u201d when the child\nwas moved out of state. The two tasks Doe identifies as impossible to complete are Task 1.1.1.5\n(which required her to participate in regular visits with the child in order to create healthy\nattachments and implement proper parenting techniques) and Task 1.1.1.6 (which required Doe\nto demonstrate an ability to provide for the child\u2019s basic developmental, medical, and other\nneeds). However, the magistrate court found that, while moving the child out of state presented\ndifficulties, those difficulties were not insurmountable.\nWith respect to visitation, the evidence presented at trial showed that the Department\nattempted to assist with visitation by referring Doe to an independent service provider so that\nvisits could take place through an independent party. However, Doe missed so many visits that\nshe was dropped from the service. The Department resumed facilitating the visitations and Doe\nagain missed the majority of them. After the magistrate court authorized out-of-state placement\nwhen the child\u2019s foster parents moved, the foster family facilitated video calls between Doe and\nthe child, as well as an in-person visit when the family returned to Idaho. However, the\nin-person visit \u201cdid not go well.\u201d Doe\u2019s failure to participate in scheduled visitations was within\nher control and not rendered impossible by the child\u2019s placement out of state.\nThe child\u2019s out-of-state placement during the child protection case also did not prevent\nDoe from demonstrating the ability to provide for the child\u2019s basic needs. Providing a single box\nof toys falls short of establishing that Doe has the ability to provide for the child\u2019s\ndevelopmental, medical, and other needs, especially the particular needs of Doe\u2019s child. The\nevidence showed that the child had medical needs to which Doe was not attentive. The child\n\u201cgot sick quite a bit\u201d and suffered from stomachaches, night terrors, and gallbladder issues that\nwere likely attributable to \u201ca lot of stress and anxiety.\u201d The child also \u201cexpresse[d] a lot of fear\nabout being with her mom.\u201d When the social worker tried to speak with Doe about the child\u2019s\n8medical issues, Doe would focus on her complaints about the court system. By comparison,\nwhile in foster care, the child received medical attention, including going to the dentist, getting\nglasses, updated immunizations, and regular counseling.\nAlthough Doe made some efforts relating to the tasks in her case plan, which the\nmagistrate court acknowledged, there was substantial and competent evidence to support the\nmagistrate court\u2019s finding of neglect, and Doe has failed to show error in this finding.\n2. Best interests of the child\nOnce a statutory ground for termination has been established, the trial court must next\ndetermine whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parent-child relationship.\nIn re Aragon, 120 Idaho 606, 611, 818 P.2d 310, 315 (1991). When determining whether\ntermination is in the child\u2019s best interests, the trial court may consider the parent\u2019s history with\nsubstance abuse, the stability and permanency of the home, the unemployment of the parent, the\nfinancial contribution of the parent to the child\u2019s care after the child is placed in protective\ncustody, the improvement of the child while in foster care, the parent\u2019s efforts to improve his or\nher situation, and the parent\u2019s continuing problems with the law. In re Doe, 159 Idaho 192, 198,\n358 P.3d 77, 83 (2015); In re Doe, 156 Idaho 103, 111, 320 P.3d 1262, 1270 (2014). A finding\nthat it is in the best interests of the child to terminate parental rights must still be made upon\nobjective grounds. In re Doe, 152 Idaho 953, 956-57, 277 P.3d 400, 403-04 (Ct. App. 2012).\nThe magistrate court found that it is in the child\u2019s best interests to terminate Doe\u2019s\nparental rights because Doe was not stable enough to parent the child and meet the child\u2019s needs.\nThe magistrate court found that Doe had \u201ca long road ahead to achieve sobriety and stability\u201d\nand that the child suffered from stress and other somatic symptoms and needed the permanency\nof a loving and stable environment. The magistrate court noted that the child was doing well\nunder the care of her foster family and that the family was a permanent placement option for the\nchild.\nDoe asserts that, had she been \u201cgiven a chance\u201d to show \u201cmastery\u201d of the tasks she\ndeemed impossible to complete once the child was moved out of state, it \u201ccould have been\nevidence negating a finding that termination was in the best interest of the child.\u201d Doe contends\nthat the child instead bonded with her foster family, which weighed against Doe in the best\ninterests analysis. Doe was given ample opportunity to complete her case plan during the two\n9years the child was in foster care and, as noted above, the child\u2019s out-of-state placement did not\nmake it impossible for Doe to complete the visitation and care-related tasks. Moreover, Doe\u2019s\nhistory with substance abuse (including ongoing use during the child protection case), her lack of\nstable and permanent housing, her failure to contribute to the child\u2019s care after the child was\nplaced in protective custody, and the child\u2019s improvement while in foster care all support the\nmagistrate court\u2019s best interests determination. Doe has not shown error in the magistrate court\u2019s\nfinding that termination is in the child\u2019s best interests.\nIV.\nCONCLUSION\nThe reviewability of the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts at reunification does not violate\ndue process. There was clear and convincing evidence that Doe neglected the child and that it is\nin the best interests of the child for Doe\u2019s parental rights to be terminated. Accordingly, the\nmagistrate court\u2019s judgment terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights is affirmed.\nChief Judge HUSKEY and Judge GRATTON, CONCUR.\n10",

See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846.\nThe district court1 found that he was a career offender, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and\n1The Honorable Linda R. Reade, United States District Judge for the Northern\nDistrict of Iowa.gave him a 197-month prison sentence, \u201cto be served consecutively\u201d to any Iowa\nsentence imposed for violating the conditions of parole. On appeal, he challenges\nthe court\u2019s application of the career-offender Guideline and its authority to sentence\nhim consecutively. We affirm.\nI.\nSnow\u2019s first argument focuses on the overlapping effects of a 2005 Iowa drug\nconviction. This conviction factored into his federal sentence in two ways. First, it\nincreased the statutory maximum for his crime from 40 years to life in prison. See\n21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851. Second, it made Snow a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under\nthe Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (discussing \u201ccontrolled substance\noffense[s]\u201d). Snow argues that using a single conviction for these two purposes was\nimpermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d that led to a miscalculated Guidelines range. He\ndid not make this argument before the district court, so our review is for plain error.\nSee United States v. Lovato, 868 F.3d 681, 684 (8th Cir. 2017). For two reasons,\nthere was no plain error here.\nFirst, the district court applied the statute and the career-offender Guideline\nthe right way. The two work in tandem with one another. Prior convictions are\ninitially used to determine whether any statutory enhancements apply. See 21 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2; see also United States v. LaBonte, 520\nU.S. 751, 758\u201359 (1997). Then, depending on the applicable statutory maximum,\nthe career-offender Guideline kicks in to reveal an offender\u2019s base offense level.\nCompare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1) (applying an offense level of 37 when the statutory\nmaximum is \u201c[l]ife\u201d), with id. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(2) (applying an offense level of 34 when\nthe statutory maximum is \u201c25 years or more\u201d). The point is that, far from prohibiting\na single conviction from \u201ccounting\u201d in both calculations, the text of the career-\noffender Guideline all but says that it does. See id. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2.\nSecond, to the extent Snow\u2019s argument is independent of the text of these\nprovisions, our decision in United States v. Quiroga suggests that what the district\n- 2 -court did here was proper. 554 F.3d 1150, 1158 (8th Cir. 2009). Quiroga involved\na factually similar scenario: a court used the same prior conviction both to increase\nthe statutory maximum and to designate the defendant as a career offender. In the\nface of a Sixth Amendment challenge, we concluded that doing so created \u201cno legal\nerror.\u201d Id. Although the nature of the challenge in this case is different, any error\nin using Snow\u2019s prior conviction for both purposes would, at a minimum, not be\n\u201cclear or obvious under\u201d Quiroga. United States v. Watson, 843 F.3d 335, 336 (8th\nCir. 2016) (citation omitted); see also United States v. Mulverhill, 833 F.3d 925, 930\n(8th Cir. 2016) (concluding that there was no plain error because we lacked a\ncontrolling case and an analogous case suggested that there was no error).\nII.\nSnow also challenges the decision to have his 197-month federal sentence run\nconsecutively to \u201cany term of imprisonment . . . imposed\u201d for violating the\nconditions of parole. His argument is that the district court lacked the authority to\nmake this determination because, without pending revocation proceedings in Iowa,\nany potential prison sentence would have been speculative.2 Our standard of review\nis de novo because Snow preserved this legal issue below. United States v. Sumlin,\n317 F.3d 780, 781\u201382 (8th Cir. 2003) (stating that questions about the district court\u2019s\nstatutory authority are reviewed de novo).\nDistrict courts generally have the discretion to impose consecutive or\nconcurrent sentences when a defendant receives multiple terms of imprisonment \u201cat\nthe same time\u201d or is \u201calready subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment\u201d at\nthe time of sentencing. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (stating that prison terms in these\ncircumstances \u201cmay run consecutively or concurrently\u201d (emphasis added)). The\nstatute is silent, however, on the situation presented here, which is how to treat\n2The district court also ordered Snow\u2019s federal sentence to run consecutively\nto any sentence imposed for pending criminal charges in Mississippi. Snow does\nnot challenge this decision, apparently because Mississippi had already filed formal\ncharges against him by the time of his sentencing.\n- 3 -potential state sentences that have yet to be imposed. Filling this void, the Supreme\nCourt has concluded that, given the \u201cdiscretion traditionally committed to\u201d judges at\nsentencing, district courts may preemptively decide whether a federal sentence and\nan \u201canticipate[d]\u201d state sentence should run consecutively or concurrently to one\nanother. Setser v. United States, 566 U.S. 231, 236\u2013237 (2012).\nAccording to Snow, applying Setser here would be a bridge too far because\nthere was no telling whether Iowa would actually seek to revoke his parole. It is true\nthat revocation proceedings had already begun in Setser by the time the district court\ndecided to order consecutive sentences. Id. at 233. Still, we do not believe this\ndistinction matters. After all, the dividing line, according to the Supreme Court, is\nwhether a state sentence is \u201canticipate[d],\u201d not whether formal proceedings have\nstarted. Id. at 236.\nIn this case, the district court anticipated that Iowa would seek a prison\nsentence. It knew that Snow was on parole for prior drug crimes, identified the\nrelevant Iowa cases by docket number, and familiarized itself with his criminal\nhistory and the facts underlying his most recent drug offense. It was no stretch to\nconclude that Snow\u2019s commission of another serious drug crime while on parole\nwould conceivably lead to more prison time in Iowa. See Iowa Code \u00a7 908.5(1); see\nalso Rhiner v. State, 703 N.W.2d 174, 177 (Iowa 2005) (describing Iowa\u2019s parole-\nrevocation procedures); Iowa Admin. Code r. 201-45.2(1) (requiring, as a standard\ncondition of parole, that a parolee \u201cobey all laws and ordinances\u201d). These facts place\nthis case squarely within Setser\u2019s domain.\nIII.\nWe accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court.\n______________________________\n- 4 -",

A12040/19\nGrange Mutual Casualty Company (\u201cappellant\u201d) appeals from the\nOctober 23, 2018 order1 docketed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny\nCounty granting in part and denying in part appellant\u2019s motion for judgment\non the pleadings in its action for declaratory judgment against\nMilano Enterprises, Inc. f/k/a Pizza Milano Enterprises, Inc.; Pizza Milano, Inc.\nt/d/b/a Pizza Milano; Sea Enterprises, LLC t/d/b/a Milano Pizza Market\n(collectively, \u201cMilano\u201d); Ashley Tait (\u201cTait\u201d), individually and as administrator\nof the estate of Carol Tait a/k/a Carol Lowrey-Tait, deceased; Lee Krenke and\nCharlene Krenke as co-administrators of the estate of Steven Vincent Krenke,2\ndeceased; Lee Krenke; Charlene Krenke; and Michael Krenke, individually.3\nAfter careful review, we affirm and remand for further proceedings.\nThe trial court set forth the following:\n[] Tait filed a lawsuit against [Milano] at GD 17-12743.\nThat suit stems from the death of Carol Tait, a\npedestrian, who was apparently struck and killed by\nan automobile driven by a pizza-delivery man [sic]\nallegedly working for Milano.

A12040/19\nemployment. [Appellant] contends it has no duty to\ndefend or indemnify Milano in that lawsuit because,\naccording to [appellant], the commercial general\nliability policy [] and the umbrella policy [] issued by\n[appellant] to Milano contain exclusions related to\nautomobile accidents. [The trial] court granted\n[appellant] judgment on the pleadings with respect to\nthe [commercial general liability policy] but denied\njudgment as to the [umbrella policy]. In this appeal,\n[appellant] asserts that the exclusion under the\n[umbrella policy] was clear and unambiguous such\nthat [appellant] has no duty to defend or indemnify\nMilano in the Tait suit.\nTrial court opinion, 12/21/18 at 2-3.\nAppellant filed a complaint on March 2, 2018, seeking a declaratory\njudgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Milano in the underlying\nlawsuit filed by Tait. On May 30, 2018, appellant filed a motion for judgment\non the pleadings, which the trial court granted in part and denied in part on\nOctober 15, 2018. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.\nSubsequently, the trial court ordered appellant to file a concise statement of\nerrors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), and appellant\ntimely complied. The trial court filed an opinion pursuant to\nPa.R.A.P. 1925(a).\nAppellant raises the following issue for our review:\nDid the [t]rial [c]ourt err in declaring that\n[appellant\u2019s] Umbrella Policy provides coverage to\nMilano [] for Ashley Tait\u2019s motor vehicle accident civil\naction despite the existence of a clear and\nunambiguous exclusion for liability arising out of the\nmaintenance, operation, or use of a motor vehicle?\nAppellant\u2019s brief at 4.\n- 3 -J. A12040/19\nOur standard of review for the grant or denial of\njudgment on the pleadings is . . . well settled.\nThe standard to be applied upon review of\na motion for judgment on the pleadings\naccepts all well-pleaded allegations of the\ncomplaint as true. The question\npresented by the demurrer is whether, on\nthe facts averred, the law says with\ncertainty that no recovery is possible.\nWhere a doubt exists as to whether a\ndemurrer should be sustained, this doubt\nshould be resolved in favor of overruling\nit.\nTucker v. Philadelphia Daily News, [] 848 A.2d\n113, 131 ([Pa.] 2004) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\nEntry of judgment on the pleadings is\npermitted under Pa.R.[Civ.]P. 1034 which\nprovides for such judgment after the\npleadings are closed, but within such time\nas not to delay trial. A motion for\njudgment on the pleadings is similar to a\ndemurrer. It may be entered when there\nare no disputed issues of fact and the\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a\nmatter of law. In determining if there is a\ndispute as to facts, the court must confine\nits consideration to the pleadings and\nrelevant documents. The scope of review\non an appeal from the grant of judgment\non the pleadings is plenary. We must\ndetermine if the action of the court below\nwas based on clear error of law or whether\nthere were facts disclosed by the\npleadings which should properly go to the\njury.\nCiticorp North America, Inc. v. Thornton, 707\nA.2d 536, 538 (Pa.Super. 1998) (citations omitted).\nLikewise,\n- 4 -J. A12040/19\nOur scope and standard of review in\nappeals of a grant or denial of a motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings is\nwell-settled. This Court applies the same\nstandard as the trial court and confines its\nconsideration to the pleadings and\ndocuments properly attached thereto. We\nreview to determine whether the trial\ncourt\u2019s action respecting the motion for\njudgment on the pleadings was based on\na clear error of law or whether there were\nfacts disclosed by the pleadings which\nshould properly go to the jury. We will\naffirm the grant of judgment on the\npleadings only if the moving party\u2019s right\nto succeed is certain and the case is so\nfree from doubt that trial would clearly be\na fruitless exercise.\nMunicipality of Mt. Lebanon v. Reliance Ins. Co.,\n778 A.2d 1228, 1231 (Pa.Super. 2001) (citations and\nquotation marks omitted).\nDonaldson v. Davidson Bros., Inc., 144 A.3d 93, 100-101 (Pa.Super.\n2016), appeal denied, 169 A.3d 11 (Pa. 2017).\nHere, appellant relies upon a policy exclusion as the basis of its denial\nof coverage and its refusal to defend. (See appellant\u2019s brief at 13.)\nThe question of whether a claim against an insured is\npotentially covered is answered by comparing the four\ncorners of the insurance contract to the four corners\nof the complaint. See Donegal Mut. Ins. Co. v.\nBaumhammers, [] 938 A.2d 286, 290 ([Pa.] 2007)\n(\u201cThe language of the policy and the allegations of the\ncomplaint must be construed together to determine\nthe insurers\u2019 obligation.\u201d). An insurer may not\njustifiably refuse to defend a claim against its insured\nunless it is clear from an examination of the\nallegations in the complaint and the language of the\npolicy that the claim does not potentially come within\nthe coverage of the policy. See [Gen. Acc. Ins. Co.\n- 5 -J. A12040/19\nof Am. v.] Allen, 692 A.2d [1089,] 1094 [(Pa. 1997)]\n(\u201cThe obligation to defend an action brought against\nthe insured is to be determined solely by the\nallegations of the complaint in the action . . . .\u201d);\nGene\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. v.

Indeed, the duty to defend is\nnot limited to meritorious actions; it even extends to\nactions that are \u201cgroundless, false, or fraudulent\u201d as\nlong as there exists the possibility that the allegations\nimplicate coverage. [Erie Ins. Exch. v.\nTransamerica Ins. Co., 533 A.2d 1363, 1368 (Pa.\n1987); Gedeon v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n188 A.2d 320, 321 (Pa. 1963)].\nAm. and Foreign Ins. Co. v. Jerry\u2019s Sport Ctr., Inc., 2 A.3d 526, 541 (Pa.\n2010).\nThis court has further instructed that:\nWhen an insurer relies on a policy exclusion as the\nbasis for its denial of coverage and refusal to defend,\nthe insurer has asserted an affirmative defense and,\naccordingly, bears the burden of proving such a\ndefense. Wilcha v. Nationwide Mutual Fire\nInsurance Company, 887 A.2d 1254, 1258\n(Pa.Super. 2005). To determine whether the insurer\nhas met its burden of proof, we rely on well-settled\n- 6 -J. A12040/19\nprinciples of contract interpretation. Id. When a\nprovision of a policy of insurance is ambiguous, the\npolicy provision is to be construed in favor of the\ninsured and against the insurer. Prudential\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Company v.\nSartno, [] 903 A.2d 1170, 1174 ([Pa.] 2006). The\ninsurance company, being the one who selects the\nlanguage in the contract, must be specific in its use.\nId. at 1177. An exclusion from liability must be clear\nand exact and unambiguous in order to be given\neffect. Id. Describing the \u201challmarks of ambiguity,\u201d\nthe Supreme Court explained that:\nContractual language is ambiguous if it is\nreasonably susceptible of different\nconstructions and capable of being\nunderstood in more than one sense. This\nis not a question to be resolved in a\nvacuum. Rather, contractual terms are\nambiguous if they are subject to more\nthan one reasonable interpretation when\napplied to a particular set of facts.\nId. (citations and quotations omitted). Thus, if we\nfind an exclusionary clause to be ambiguous, we\nconstrue it in favor of the insured. Id. But if the\nlanguage is not ambiguous, we must enforce the\nexclusion. Id.\nWall Rose Mut. Ins. Co. v. Manross, 939 A.2d 958, 962-963 (Pa.Super.\n2007), appeal denied, 946 A.2d 688 (Pa. 2008).\nWe begin our discussion with the underlying lawsuit Tait filed against\nMilano. Therein, Tait filed a cause of action sounding in negligent hiring and\nretention and respondeat superior pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act and\nthe Survival Act.4 (See generally Brief in support of appellant\u2019s motion for\n4 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8301 and 8302, respectively.\n- 7 -J. A12040/19\njudgment on the pleadings, 5/30/18, Exhibit A; R.R. at 42a-53a.) Specifically,\nTait\u2019s complaint alleges that while he was in the scope and course of his\nemployment with Milano as a pizza delivery driver, Steven Vincent Krenke\n(\u201cKrenke\u201d) was operating \u201ca vehicle\u201d on February 14, 2016, when he struck\nCarol Tait as she was attempting to cross Ohio River Boulevard in Bellevue,\nPennsylvania, causing her to sustain fatal injuries. (Id.; R.R. at 46a.) Tait\u2019s\ncomplaint alleges that at the time of the accident, Krenke was driving with a\nsuspended license and was driving under the influence of a controlled\nsubstance. (Id.) The complaint further alleges the following:\n[I]t is clear that [Milano] either did not conduct a\nsimple review of Krenke\u2019s criminal docket to discover\nthe driving offenses or [Milano] did conduct a review,\nbut allowed Krenke to drive for their business anyway\ndespite his long history of criminal and driving\noffenses.\nFurthermore, it is clear that [Milano] failed to have\nany policy or procedure in place to ensure that their\ndelivery drivers had current and valid drivers\u2019 licenses\nwhile working as delivery drivers for their business.\nAt the time of this accident, Krenke did not possess a\nvalid drivers\u2019 license and should not have been\noperating a vehicle at any time and especially in the\nscope and course of his employment with [Milano].\nId.; R.R. at 47a (numbered paragraphs omitted).5\n5 We note that Tait\u2019s complaint does not specify who owned the vehicle Krenke\nwas driving at the time of the accident. In appellant\u2019s declaratory judgment\ncomplaint, appellant avers that \u201c[] Tait alleges that [] Krenke caused an\naccident with his motor vehicle while he was acting within the course and\nscope of his employment as a deliver driver for [] Milano. (Appellant\u2019s\namended complaint, 4/30/18 at 2 (emphasis added).)\n- 8 -J. A12040/19\nWe now turn to the umbrella policy (\u201cUP\u201d), which is the subject of the\ninstant appeal. As argued by Milano, umbrella policies are designed to\n\u201cprovide for a higher limit for those losses typically covered by [underlying]\nliability insurance\u201d and \u201cto provide for some coverage of those less common\nlosses not typically covered by liability insurance[.]\u201d Treesdale, Inc. v.

(See Milano\u2019s brief at 11;\n7 The commercial general liability policy is the only policy identified on the UP\u2019s\nschedule of underlying insurance. (See brief in support of appellant\u2019s motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings, 5/30/18, Exhibit D, Commercial Liability\nUmbrella Declarations Schedule of Underlying Insurance at 2; R.R. at 163a.)\n- 11 -J.

A12040/19\n33, 35-36; R.R. at 99a, 101a, 103a-104a (emphasis added). The claims\nasserted in the underlying lawsuit are clearly excluded under the CGL policy.\nBased on our comparison of the four corners of the UP with the four\ncorners of Tait\u2019s underlying complaint, we find that an ambiguity exists as it\nrelates to the UP\u2019s auto exclusion. Indeed, the UP does not specifically contain\nan exclusion of coverage for claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing\nin the supervision, hiring, employment, training, or monitoring of others by\nan insured resulting in bodily injury or property damage involving the\nownership, maintenance, or use of any auto which is not a \u201ccovered auto,\u201d\nunlike the CGL policy, which contains an explicit exclusion of such coverage.\n(See brief in support of appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n5/30/18, Exhibit D, Commercial Liability Umbrella Coverage Form (Policy\nNo. CU 00 01 04 13 at 1, 3; R.R. at 172a, 174a; brief in support of appellant\u2019s\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, 5/30/18, Exhibit C, Businessowners\nCoverage Form (Policy No. BP 00 03 01 10) at 31, 33, 35-36; R.R. at 99a,\n101a, 103-104a).\nTo further establish this ambiguity, the UP also contains an exclusion for\npersonal injury or property damage pertaining to aircraft or watercraft that\nreads as follows:\nj. Aircraft or Watercraft\n\u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d\narising out of the ownership,\nmaintenance, use or entrustment to\nothers of any aircraft or watercraft\n- 13 -J.

Use includes\noperation and \u201cloading or\nunloading.\u201d\nThis exclusion applies even if the\nclaims against any insured\nallege negligence or other\nwrongdoing in the supervision,\nhiring, employment, training or\nmonitoring of others by that\ninsured, if the \u201coccurrence\u201d\nwhich caused the \u201cbodily injury\u201d\nor \u201cproperty damage\u201d involved\nthe ownership, maintenance,\nuse or entrustment to others of\nany aircraft or watercraft that is\nowned or operated by or rented\nor loaned to any insured.\nBrief in support of appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, 5/30/18,\nExhibit D, UP Revised Coverage Provisions, Endorsement CU02 (Policy\nNo. CUP 2008174), unnumbered page 1 of 2; R.R. at 190a (emphasis added).\nThis clause is conspicuously absent from the UP\u2019s auto exclusion.\nThe record reflects that appellant is the author of both the CGL policy\nand the UP. As noted by Milano, if appellant intended for the auto exclusion\nin the UP to apply to claims alleging negligent supervision, hiring,\nemployment, training, or monitoring of others by the insured, it could have\nexpressly included such a clause in the UP, just as it did for the aircraft and\nwatercraft exclusion in the UP and the exclusion relating to aircraft, auto, and\nwatercraft in the CGL policy. (See Milano\u2019s brief at 12.)\n- 14 -J. A12040/19\nAppellant directs us to our en banc decision in Wolfe v. Ross, 115 A.3d\n880 (Pa.Super. 2015) (en banc). In Wolfe, the 19-year-old decedent\nattended a high school graduation party hosted by the defendant where\nalcohol was furnished. Id. at 882-883. The underlying complaint alleged that\nthe decedent, \u201cas a direct and proximate result of the impairment caused by\nthe alcohol,\u201d left the party on a dirt bike owned by the defendant\u2019s son, lost\ncontrol of the bike, struck a stationary object, and died as a result of his\ninjuries. Id. at 883. The cause of action against the defendant sounded in\nnegligence and arose from the furnishing of alcohol to a minor. Id. The\ndefendant\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance policy contained a coverage exclusion for\n\u201cbodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance,\nuse, loading or unloading of a motor vehicle owned or operated by or rented\nor loaned to any insured.\u201d Id. at 885 (formatting altered and citations\nomitted). We held as follows:\nThe fact that the serving of alcohol to a minor\nsubjected [the defendant] to liability even without the\ninvolvement of a motor vehicle does not change the\nfact that the policy language excludes coverage for\ninjuries arising out of use of a motor vehicle. It is\nundisputed that the decedent\u2019s use of the ATV was\nboth the proximate cause and the cause in fact of his\ninjury. We find no ambiguity in the exclusionary\nlanguage on the facts herein.\nId. at 889.\nIn its brief, appellant contends that it would be \u201clogically consistent\u201d to\n\u201cextend the Wolfe reasoning to umbrella policies.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s brief at 22.)\n- 15 -J. A12040/19\nIn support of its contention, appellant invites this court to adopt the holding\nof the Wisconsin Court of Appeals in Flejter v. West Bend Mut. Ins. Co.,\n793 N.W.2d 913 (Wis. Ct. App. 2010). (See appellant\u2019s brief at 22-24.) In\nFlejter, the court considered whether a general commercial liability policy and\nan umbrella policy containing virtually identical language to the policies at\nissue in the instant case8 provided coverage for damages sought by the\nplaintiffs in an underlying tort case.9 Id. at 915. The Flejter court found in\n8 The Flejter court reproduced the following relevant language from the\ngeneral commercial liability policy:\nThis insurance does not apply to bodily injury or\nproperty damage arising out of the ownership,\nmaintenance, use or entrustment to others of any\nauto owned by any insured.\nThis exclusion applies even if the claims against any\ninsured allege negligence or other wrongdoing in the\nsupervision, hiring, employment, training or\nmonitoring of others that by insured, if the occurrence\nwhich caused bodily injury or property damage\ninvolved the ownership, maintenance, use or\nentrustment to others of any auto that is owned by\nthe insured.\nFlejter, 793 N.W.2d at 915 (formatting modified, ellipses and quotation\nmarks omitted). The court reproduced the following relevant language from\nthe umbrella policy: \u201cThis insurance does not apply to bodily injury or\nproperty damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any auto\nwhich is not a covered auto.\u201d Id. (formatting modified, ellipses and quotation\nmarks omitted).\n9 In the underlying case, the plaintiffs filed a cause of action sounding in\nnegligent hiring, supervising, training, and retaining of an employee who was\ndriving a company vehicle for personal use when he was involved in a fatal\ncar accident. Id. at 914.\n- 16 -J. A12040/19\nfavor of the defendant insurance carrier, rejecting the plaintiffs\u2019 contention\nthat the independent concurrent cause doctrine should apply. Id. at 920.\nUnlike our Wisconsin counterparts, we are unable to review the entire policy\nconsidered by the court of appeals when reaching its decision. Because the\ninstant case rests upon whether the UP\u2019s exclusionary language was\nambiguous, we find Flejter to be of limited persuasive value here.\nTherefore, we find that the exclusionary language at issue in the UP is\nambiguous and must be construed in favor of Milano. Manross, 939 A.2d at\n963, citing Sartno, 903 A.2d at 1174. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court\ndid not err when it denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings\npertaining to coverage under the UP.\nOrder affirmed. Case remanded for further proceedings. Jurisdiction\nrelinquished.\nJudgment Entered.\nJoseph D. Seletyn, Esq.\nProthonotary\nDate: 2/10/2020\n- 17 -",

(born October 11, 2017). Respondent father is not a\nparty to this appeal. On appeal, respondent argues the court\u2019s fitness and best-interest findings\nwere against the manifest weight of the evidence. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n\u00b6 3 I. BACKGROUND\n\u00b6 4 A. Initial Proceedings\n\u00b6 5 In October 2017, the State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship, alleging\nB.L. was neglected where (1) B.L.\u2019s system contained an amount of a controlled substance at\nbirth (705 ILCS 405/2-3(1)(c) (West 2016)), (2) respondent subjected B.L. to an injuriousenvironment due to her substance abuse (705 ILCS 405/2-3(1)(b) (West 2016)), and (3) B.L.\u2019s\nenvironment was injurious to his welfare because respondent failed to correct the conditions that\nled her two older children to come into care (see Vermilion County case Nos. 16-JA-08 and 16-\nJA-09) (705 ILCS 405/2-3(1)(b) (West 2016)). After a shelter care hearing, the trial court\ngranted the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) temporary custody of B.L.\n\u00b6 6 At a December 2017 adjudicatory hearing, respondent stipulated to the allegations\nof neglect in count I of the State\u2019s petition. In a February 2018 dispositional order, the trial court\n(1) found respondent unfit, (2) made B.L. a ward of the court, and (3) granted DCFS\nguardianship and custody.\n\u00b6 7 B. Termination Proceedings\n\u00b6 8 In October 2018, the State filed a petition to terminate respondent\u2019s parental\nrights. The State alleged respondent (1) failed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest,\nconcern, or responsibility as to B.L.\u2019s welfare (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(b) (West 2016)); (2) failed to\nmake reasonable efforts to correct the conditions that were the basis of the removal of B.L. from\nrespondent nine months after an adjudication of neglect, specifically January 5, 2018, to October\n5, 2018 (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m)(i) (West 2016)); (3) failed to make reasonable progress toward\nthe return of B.L. within nine months after an adjudication of neglect, specifically January 5,\n2018, to October 5, 2018 (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m)(ii) (West 2016)); and (4) deserted B.L. for more\nthan three months preceding the commencement of this action (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(c) (West\n2016)).\n\u00b6 9 1. Fitness Hearing\n- 2 -\u00b6 10 In May 2019, the trial court conducted a bifurcated hearing on the petition for\ntermination of parental rights, first considering respondent\u2019s fitness. The parties presented the\nfollowing relevant testimony.\n\u00b6 11 a. Tia Manierre\n\u00b6 12 Tia Manierre worked as the Children\u2019s Home and Aid caseworker for respondent\nfrom June 2017 to January 2019. Manierre testified that respondent completed an integrated\nassessment. Services required of respondent included substance-abuse treatment, parenting\neducation, mental health and counseling services, and domestic-violence treatment. In addition,\nrespondent needed to maintain stable housing and employment.\n\u00b6 13 Respondent successfully completed inpatient treatment for substance abuse but\nrelapsed a week later. Although respondent periodically attended outpatient substance-abuse\ntreatment, she never successfully completed her substance-abuse services. Manierre testified\nrespondent sometimes participated in drug drops and the last drug drop, completed in February\n2018, tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Respondent completed parenting\nclasses in January 2019. Respondent failed to complete any other recommended services.\n\u00b6 14 Respondent only attended one visit with B.L. during the relevant nine-month\nperiod and failed to maintain regular contact with Manierre. Manierre did testify that respondent\nasked for pictures of B.L. and, at one point, respondent sent B.L. cards.\n\u00b6 15 b. Trial Court\u2019s Findings\n\u00b6 16 After hearing the evidence, the trial court found, by clear and convincing\nevidence, respondent unfit on four separate grounds. The court noted substance abuse was the\nprimary issue respondent needed to fix. However, respondent only remained clean during her\ninpatient treatment and then relapsed within a week after leaving treatment. The court also found\n- 3 -respondent needed mental health counseling but that she never obtained a referral for mental\nhealth counseling. In September 2019, the trial court entered a finding of parental unfitness.\n\u00b6 17 2. Best-Interest Hearing\n\u00b6 18 According to the docket, in September 2019, the trial court held a separate best-\ninterest hearing. No transcript of the best-interest hearing is provided in the record. According\nto the docket, the trial court found it was in B.L.\u2019s best interest to terminate respondent\u2019s parental\nrights. Subsequently, the court entered a dispositional order after a finding of parental unfitness.\nIn the order, the court found that it was in B.L.\u2019s best interest to terminate respondent\u2019s parental\nrights and noted its consideration of the relevant best-interest factors. The court found B.L. had\ndeveloped and maintained a bond with his foster family and that no bond existed between B.L.\nand respondent.\n\u00b6 19 This appeal followed.\n\u00b6 20 II. ANALYSIS\n\u00b6 21 On appeal, respondent argues the trial court erred in finding respondent to be an\nunfit parent and terminating her parental rights. We address these arguments in turn.\n\u00b6 22 A. Fitness Finding\n\u00b6 23 In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the State has the burden of proving\nparental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. In re Jordan V., 347 Ill. App. 3d 1057,\n1067, 808 N.E.2d 596, 604 (2004). In making a determination, the court considers whether the\nparent\u2019s conduct falls within one or more of the unfitness grounds described in section 1(D) of\nthe Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2016)). Evidence of unfitness based on any ground\nenumerated in section 1(D) of the Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2016)) is enough to\nsupport a finding of unfitness. In re C.W., 199 Ill. 2d 198, 210, 766 N.E.2d 1105, 1113 (2002).\n- 4 -A reviewing court will not overturn the trial court\u2019s finding of unfitness unless it is against the\nmanifest weight of the evidence. Jordan V., 347 Ill. App. 3d at 1067. The trial court\u2019s decision\nis given great deference due to \u201cits superior opportunity to observe the witnesses and evaluate\ntheir credibility.\u201d Id.\n\u00b6 24 The trial court found respondent unfit on four different grounds: (1) failure to\nmaintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern, or responsibility as to B.L.\u2019s welfare (750\nILCS 50/1(D)(b) (West 2016)); (2) failure to make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions\nthat were the basis of the removal of B.L. from respondent nine months after an adjudication of\nneglect, specifically January 5, 2018, to October 5, 2018 (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(m)(i) (West 2016));\n(3) failure to make reasonable progress toward the return of B.L. within nine months after an\nadjudication of neglect, specifically January 5, 2018, to October 5, 2018 (750 ILCS\n50/1(D)(m)(ii) (West 2016)); and (4) desertion for more than three months preceding the\ncommencement of the action (750 ILCS 50/1(D)(c) (West 2016)). We turn first to the\nreasonable-progress grounds.\n\u00b6 25 The trial court\u2019s finding that respondent failed to make reasonable progress\ntoward the return of B.L. within nine months following the adjudication of neglect was not\nagainst the manifest weight of the evidence. Reasonable progress is measured by an objective\nstandard that considers the progress made toward the goal of returning the child to the parent. In\nre M.A., 325 Ill. App. 3d 387, 391, 757 N.E.2d 613, 617 (2001). Specifically, reasonable\nprogress includes a parent\u2019s compliance with service plans and court directives, in light of the\ncondition that gave rise to the removal of the child. In re C.N., 196 Ill. 2d 181, 216, 752 N.E.2d\n1030, 1050 (2001). A parent has made reasonable progress when \u201cthe progress being made by a\nparent to comply with directives given for the return of the child is sufficiently demonstrable and\n- 5 -of such quality that the court, in the near future, will be able to order the child returned to\nparental custody.\u201d (Emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.) In re F.P., 2014 IL App\n(4th) 140360, \u00b6 88, 19 N.E.3d 227.\n\u00b6 26 During the relevant time period (January 5, 2018, through October 5, 2018),\nrespondent\u2019s service plans required (1) substance-abuse treatment, (2) parenting education,\n(3) mental health and counseling services, (4) domestic-violence treatment, and (5) respondent\nmaintain stable housing and employment. The evidence established respondent completed\nparenting classes in January 2019, after the relevant nine-month period. Further, respondent\ncompleted inpatient treatment for substance abuse but relapsed a week later and sporadically\nattended outpatient substance-abuse treatment. Respondent failed a drug drop in February 2018,\nwhere she tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. Thus, respondent never\ncompleted the substance-abuse treatment requirement. The evidence further established\nrespondent failed to obtain a referral for mental-health counseling or domestic-violence\ntreatment. Finally, respondent only visited B.L. once during the relevant nine-month period.\n\u00b6 27 Respondent argues she made reasonable progress because she was working on her\nsubstance-abuse issues and DCFS did not allow her to participate in services until she worked on\nher substance-abuse issues. The State argues DCFS never stated that it would prohibit\nrespondent from participating in services until she worked on her substance-abuse issues.\nRather, the State asserts respondent\u2019s argument is from a report in the record where Manierre\ninformed respondent that \u201cit would be best if she focus[ed] on parenting classes and substance[-\n]abuse treatment before beginning other services.\u201d We agree with the State that nowhere in the\nrecord did DCFS inform respondent she must work on her substance-abuse issues before\nengaging in other services.\n- 6 -\u00b6 28 Absent in the record is any indication that the court, in the near future, would\nhave been able to return B.L. to respondent. Given respondent\u2019s failure to complete the required\nservices, we cannot say the trial court\u2019s determination respondent failed to make reasonable\nprogress toward having B.L. returned to her care within nine months following the adjudication\nof neglect was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Because we have upheld the trial\ncourt\u2019s findings as to one ground of unfitness, we need not review the other grounds. See In re\nD.H., 323 Ill. App. 3d 1, 9, 751 N.E.2d 54, 61 (2001).\n\u00b6 29 B. Best-Interest Finding\n\u00b6 30 Once the trial court determines a parent to be unfit, the next stage is to determine\nwhether it is in the best interest of the minor to terminate parental rights. In re Jaron Z., 348 Ill.\nApp. 3d 239, 261, 810 N.E.2d 108, 126 (2004). The State must prove by a preponderance of the\nevidence that termination is in the best interest of the minor. Id. The trial court\u2019s finding will\nnot be overturned unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Id. at 261-62.\n\u00b6 31 Respondent argues that because she was unable to timely complete substance-\nabuse treatment and was not allowed visits with B.L. until her substance-abuse issues were\ncontrolled, she was unable to bond with B.L. However, respondent failed to provide this court\nwith a record of the September 2019 best-interest hearing, and therefore respondent failed to\nsubmit a complete record to this court.\n\u00b6 32 Illinois Supreme Court Rule 323(a) provides \u201cA report of proceedings may\ninclude evidence, oral rulings of the trial judge, a brief statement of the trial judge of the reasons\nfor his decision, and any other proceedings that the party submitting it desires to have\nincorporated in the record on appeal. The report of proceedings shall include all the evidence\npertinent to the issues on appeal.\u201d Ill. S. Ct. R. 323(a) (eff. July 1, 2017).\n- 7 -\u201cRule 323, like the other supreme court rules governing appeals, is\nnot a mere suggestion. [Citation.] Rather, the rule has the force\nand effect of law and is binding on litigants as well as the courts.\n[Citation.] As a consequence, when a report of proceedings, or a\nsubstitute, is essential to resolving an appeal and the appellant has\nfailed to provide this court with such a record, we must presume\nthat the trial court followed the law and had a sufficient factual\nbasis for its ruling.\u201d In re Marriage of Thomsen, 371 Ill. App. 3d\n236, 241, 872 N.E.2d 1, 6 (2007).\n\u00b6 33 Here, respondent fails to provide the transcript of the September 2019 best-\ninterest hearing in the record on appeal. Therefore, we must presume the trial court followed the\nlaw and had a sufficient basis for its ruling. Moreover, the trial court in a dispositional order\nafter a finding of parental unfitness stated the court considered the relevant best-interest factors\n(705 ILCS 405/1-3(4.05) (West 2016)) in making its decision that it was in B.L.\u2019s best interest to\nterminate respondent\u2019s parental rights.\n\u00b6 34 Accordingly, we conclude the trial court\u2019s finding it was in B.L.\u2019s best interests to\nterminate respondent\u2019s parental rights was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n\u00b6 35 III. CONCLUSION\n\u00b6 36 For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\n\u00b6 37 Affirmed.\n- 8 -",

Hon. Thomas J. Ryan, District Judge.\nJudgment of conviction for lewd conduct with a minor child under\nsixteen, affirmed.\nEric D. Fredericksen, State Appellate Public Defender; Jenevieve C. Swinford,\nDeputy Appellate Public Defender, Boise, for appellant.\nHon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Jeffery D. Nye, Deputy Attorney\nGeneral, Boise, for respondent.\n________________________________________________\nBRAILSFORD, Judge\nLuis Juan Nevarez timely appeals from his judgment of conviction entered after a jury\nfound him guilty of lewd conduct with a minor child under sixteen, Idaho Code \u00a7 18-1508. We\naffirm.\nI.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\nOn the night in question, Nevarez was at his cousin\u2019s house watching movies. The\nvictim was Nevarez\u2019s cousin\u2019s daughter, A.N., who was twelve-years-old at the time. At trial,\nA.N. testified that she was sitting on a sectional couch, covered by a blanket, watching a scary\nmovie. Nevarez was sitting on her left and other family members, including her father, were\nsitting to Nevarez\u2019s left. A.N. further testified that, during the movie, Nevarez put his hand\n1underneath her blanket; touched her thigh; put his hand inside her shorts; \u201ctried putting his hand\nin [her] bottom private\u201d; \u201ctried touching [her] vagina\u201d; and touched the \u201ctop of [her] private.\u201d\nA.N. explained that the phrases \u201c[her] bottom private\u201d meant her vagina and \u201c[her] upper\nprivate\u201d meant her \u201cboobs.\u201d\nA.N. also testified that, at one point, she attempted to leave the couch, but Nevarez held\nher in place. She was too scared to make any noise, but before the movie was over, she left the\nroom, ran to her parents\u2019 room and hid. After the movie was over, A.N. told her sisters what\nhappened and was described by witnesses as very emotional, crying, and distraught. One of\nA.N.\u2019s sisters told A.N.\u2019s father, who confronted Nevarez outside of the house as he was leaving.\nA.N.\u2019s mother called the police, and the State charged Nevarez with lewd conduct with a minor\nchild under sixteen.\nAfter the State rested its case, Nevarez moved to dismiss the charge, arguing the State\nfailed to prove Nevarez touched A.N.\u2019s genitals. The district court denied Nevarez\u2019s motion,\nfinding that \u201cthe evidence [was] at least sufficient [that] a reasonable jury might factually find\nthat it was a manual-to-genital contact.\u201d The jury found Nevarez guilty, and he timely appeals.\nII.\nANALYSIS\nNevarez challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction. Appellate\nreview of the sufficiency of the evidence is limited in scope. A finding of guilt will not be\noverturned on appeal where there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact\ncould have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the essential elements of a\ncrime beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho 383, 385, 957 P.2d 1099,\n1101 (Ct. App. 1998); State v. Knutson, 121 Idaho 101, 104, 822 P.2d 998, 1001 (Ct. App.\n1991). We will not substitute our view for that of the trier of fact as to the credibility of the\nwitnesses, the weight to be given to the testimony, and the reasonable inferences to be drawn\nfrom the evidence. Knutson, 121 Idaho at 104, 822 P.2d at 1001; State v. Decker, 108 Idaho 683,\n684, 701 P.2d 303, 304 (Ct. App. 1985). Moreover, we will consider the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the prosecution. Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho at 385, 957 P.2d at 1101; Knutson,\n121 Idaho at 104, 822 P.2d at 1001.\nIn this case, the district court instructed the jury that the State had to prove Nevarez\n\u201ccommitted an act of manual-to-genital contact\u201d in order to find him guilty of lewd conduct with\n2a minor under sixteen. See I.C. \u00a7 18-1508 (identifying types of contact constituting lewd and\nlascivious act). Nevarez argues no rational jury could have found the State proved manual-to-\ngenital contact. Specifically, Nevarez challenges A.N.\u2019s description of his conduct as\ninsufficient to prove manual-to-genital contact. Regarding Nevarez\u2019s conduct, A.N. testified:\nQ. What happened when he put his hand underneath your blanket?\nA. He started touching me.\nQ. Where did he start touching you?\nA. On my legs.\n. . . .\nQ. How did he touch you? Did he use all of his--both his hands? One hand?\nA. One hand.\nQ. Where was it that he first touched you on your leg?\nA. My thigh.\n. . . .\nQ. What did he do after that?\nA. He tried putting his hand in my bottom private.\nQ. How did he try to put his hand in your bottom private?\nA. He put his hand inside my shorts, and he tried--he tried touching my\nvagina.\nQ. Did his hands go inside your shorts? Or let me ask, did his hand go inside\nyour shorts?\nA. Yes.\n. . . .\nQ. What part of your shorts was it that his hand got in?\nA. My, like, the bottom part.\nQ. The bottom part where your legs come out?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Were you wearing anything other than your shorts?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What else did you have on?\nA. My underwear.\nQ. When [Nevarez\u2019s] hand went under the bottom part of your shorts, what\ndid he touch?\nA. The top of my private.\nQ. Would it help you explain what you mean by the top of your private if you\nsaw a diagram of a girl\u2019s body?\nA. Yes.\n. . . .\nQ. Okay. You indicated that [Nevarez] was touching the top of your private.\nCan you, with that purple pen, show the jury what part of your body\nyou\u2019re talking about?\nA. (Witness complied.)\n3In response to the prosecutor\u2019s request that A.N. identify \u201cthe top of [her] private\u201d on the\ndiagram of an unclothed girl, A.N. drew a line on the diagram starting at the thigh and ending on\nthe lower abdomen.\nBased on this testimony, Nevarez argues A.N.\u2019s description that Nevarez touched \u201cthe\ntop of my private\u201d does not mean Nevarez touched her \u201cprivate\u201d and that A.N.\u2019s marking on the\ndiagram resolves \u201cany ambiguity\u201d by showing that Nevarez only touched A.N.\u2019s \u201clower\nabdomen\u201d and not her \u201cupper external genitalia.\u201d The State argues that A.N.\u2019s marking on the\ndiagram shows Nevarez touched A.N.\u2019s \u201cmons pubis,\u201d which Nevarez concedes is part of the\nfemale genitalia. We agree with the State.\nThe Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford v. State, 160 Idaho 586, 595, 377 P.3d\n400, 409 (2016), is instructive. In Crawford, the State charged Crawford with lewd conduct with\na minor under sixteen, alleging manual-to-genital contact. Id. at 589, 377 P.3d at 403. At trial,\nthe victim testified Crawford touched the \u201c[o]utside of [her] vaginal area.\u201d Id. at 590, 377 P.3d\nat 404. On appeal from the dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief, Crawford argued\nthere was insufficient evident to support his conviction because the phrase \u201coutside of [the\nvictim\u2019s] vaginal area\u201d \u201ccould not reasonably be interpreted to constitute manual-genital\ncontact.\u201d Id. at 595, 377 P.3d 409. The Court noted that the phrase was susceptible to more than\none reasonable interpretation, including that Crawford \u201ctouched [the victim\u2019s] external genitalia\nnear her internal genitalia.\u201d Id. The Court further noted that the \u201c[f]emale external genitalia\nconsist of the clitoris, the mons pubis, the labia minora and labia majora, and the vestibule of the\nvagina.\u201d1 Id. at 595 n.4, 377 P.3d at 409 n.4. Construing both the ambiguity and the evidence in\nfavor of the State, the Court concluded an Idaho Criminal Rule 29 motion for insufficient\nevidence would not likely have been successful, and thus Crawford\u2019s counsel was not ineffective\nfor failing to make such a motion. Id. at 595, 377 P.3d at 409.\nNevarez attempts to distinguish this case from Crawford by arguing that the phrase \u201ctop\nof [her] private\u201d is ambiguous, but that A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram of the unclothed girl\n\u201cdispel[led] any ambiguity.\u201d Based on A.N. marking on the diagram, Nevarez asserts the only\nreasonable interpretation is that Nevarez only \u201ctouched A.N.\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201d We disagree.\n1 The Court also noted that \u201cto constitute lewd and lascivious conduct, it is not necessary\nthat bare skin be touched. The touching may be through the clothing.\u201d Crawford, 160 Idaho at\n595, 377 P.3d at 409 (quotations omitted).\n4Just as in Crawford, A.N.\u2019s testimony in this case that Nevarez touched \u201cthe top of [her]\nprivate\u201d may mean that Nevarez touched her external genitalia. To the extent the phrase \u201cthe top\nof [her] private\u201d is ambiguous, the jury\u2019s province was to determine what A.N. meant by the\nphrase, and we will not substitute our view for that of the jury as to the reasonable inferences to\nbe drawn from the evidence. See State v. Neyhart, 160 Idaho 746, 751, 378 P.3d 1045, 1050 (Ct.\nApp. 2016) (ruling determining what victim meant by \u201cprivate\u201d was within jury\u2019s province).\nMoreover, A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram of the unclothed girl does not support Nevarez\u2019s claim\nthat he only \u201ctouched A.N.\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201d To the contrary, the marking tends to support the\nopposite, showing A.N. indicated Nevarez touched the mons pubis, which is part of the female\nexternal genitalia, as Nevarez concedes.\nConstruing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, there is substantial\nevidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found the State sustained its burden\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of proving manual-to-genital contact. See Herrera-Brito, 131 Idaho\nat 385, 957 P.2d at 1101 (ruling court will not overturn judgment of conviction supported by\nsubstantial evidence upon which reasonable trier of fact could have found burden sustained\nbeyond reasonable doubt).\nIII.\nCONCLUSION\nSubstantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of Nevarez\u2019s manual-to-genital contact\nwith A.N., and thus his conviction for lewd conduct with a minor child under sixteen by manual-\nto-genital contact. Accordingly, we affirm Nevarez\u2019s judgment of conviction.\nJudge GRATTON and Judge LORELLO CONCUR.\n5",

Ms. Zayas is entitled to the benefit of this change in the law\nbecause it occurred before the district court entered judgment on September 28, 2018.\nSee Bradley v. Sch. Bd. of City of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711 (1974) (stating \u201cthe\nprinciple that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,\nunless doing so would result in manifest injustice or there is statutory direction or\nlegislative history to the contrary\u201d).\nMs. Zayas moved to withdraw her guilty plea on the basis that it was not\nknowing and voluntary because the district court had failed to explain adequately the\nmens rea requirement. The district court denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion, determining the\nInformation adequately informed Ms. Zayas of the recklessness requirement and that\nMs. Zayas had admitted facts consistent with that requirement in her plea agreement.\nBecause nothing in the record informed Ms. Zayas that the government would\nbe required to prove that she knew, rather than merely should have known, of the\nrisk, we conclude her plea was not knowing and voluntary and reverse the district\ncourt\u2019s denial of Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw.1\n1 Ms. Zayas\u2019s briefing appears to challenge the acceptance of her guilty plea,\nnot the denial of her motion to withdraw the plea. At oral argument, Ms. Zayas\u2019s\ncounsel clarified that Ms. Zayas is challenging the district court\u2019s denial of her\nmotion to withdraw the plea. The government is not prejudiced by this clarification\nbecause the government interpreted Ms. Zayas\u2019s briefing as a challenge to the denial\nof her motion to withdraw the plea.\n2I. BACKGROUND\nA. Factual History\nDuring the relevant time period, Ms. Zayas was a member of the Air Force\nliving on Holloman Air Force base. On October 22, 2007, Ms. Zayas found her\ntwo-month-old daughter, Annalicia Zayas, unresponsive thirty minutes after putting\nAnnalicia down for a nap. An autopsy showed Annalicia had suffered multiple skull\nfractures, hemorrhages, and scalp contusions within two to three hours of her death.\nThe autopsy also revealed Annalicia had ten rib fractures in various stages of healing;\nhealing fractures to her right wrist bones; and lesions on her body, consistent with\ncigarette burns, some of which were healing. The medical examiner ruled Annalicia\u2019s\ndeath a homicide.\nOn April 24, 2012, a grand jury indicted Ms. Zayas, charging her with various\nviolations of New Mexico law under the Assimilated Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7,\n13.2 Ms. Zayas was arrested that same day. The United States filed multiple\nsuperseding indictments before Ms. Zayas agreed to plead guilty to an Information.\nThe Information charged Ms. Zayas with the assimilated state crime of child abuse\n2 The Assimilated Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13, \u201cperforms a gap-filling function\nby \u2018borrowing state law\u2019 to bolster the \u2018federal criminal law that applies on federal\nenclaves.\u2019\u201d United States v. Jones, 921 F.3d 932, 935 (10th Cir. 2019) (quoting Lewis\nv. United States, 523 U.S. 155, 160 (1998)). It provides that anyone \u201cguilty of any act\nor omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress,\nwould be punishable if committed . . . within the jurisdiction of the State . . . in\nwhich [the federal enclave] is situated, . . . shall be guilty of a like offense and\nsubject to a like punishment.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a). The Air Force base where Annalicia\nZayas died is a federal enclave.\n3resulting in great bodily harm, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 13 and N.M. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7 30-6-1(D)(1), (D)(2), and (E). Specifically, the Information alleged,\nFrom on or about August 16, 2007, through on or about October 22,\n2007, . . . in the District of New Mexico, at Holloman Air Force\nBase, . . . the defendant, Sophia Monique Zayas, did negligently, and\nwithout justifiable cause, cause and permit Jane Doe #1 . . . to be placed\nin a situation that may endanger Jane Doe #1\u2019s life and health, and to be\ntortured and to be cruelly punished, which resulted in great bodily harm\nto Jane Doe #1.\nROA, Vol. I at 170.3\nOn February 24, 2014, pursuant to a plea agreement, Ms. Zayas pleaded guilty\nto the Information. The plea agreement included the following admission of facts:\nOn or about August 16, 2007 through October 22, 2007, I caused or\npermitted Annalicia Zayas, my daughter who was less than 12 years of\nage, to be placed in a situation which endangered her life or health or\ntortured, cruelly confined or cruelly punished her.\nI knew or should have known that my conduct created a substantial and\nforeseeable risk that my daughter, Annalicia Zayas, would be physically\nharmed or killed. I disregarded that risk, and I was wholly indifferent to\nthe consequences of the conduct and to the welfare and safety of my\ndaughter, Annalicia Zayas.\nMy actions resulted in great bodily harm to Annalicia.\nSpecifically, as a result of my actions, my daughter sustained the\nfollowing injuries between August 16, 2007 through October 22, 2007,\nthat constitute great bodily harm:\n3 The Information did not charge Ms. Zayas with abusing Annalicia, rather, it\ncharged Ms. Zayas with failing to protect Annalicia. Ms. Zayas has maintained that\nher codefendant and husband, Peter Zayas, was responsible for inflicting the injuries\nthat caused Annalicia\u2019s death. Although Mr. Zayas made inconsistent statements\nregarding who was responsible for Annalicia\u2019s death, on at least two occasions he\nclaimed sole responsibility for Annalicia\u2019s injuries.\n4(1) Posterior transverse skull fractures;\n(2) Rib fractures on at least two occasions; and\n(3) Radius and Ulna fractures\nMy actions and the above injuries all occurred in New Mexico, at\nHolloman Air Force Base.\nROA, Vol. I at 175\u201376.\nAs part of the plea agreement, Ms. Zayas \u201cagrees and represents that [her] plea\nof guilty is freely and voluntarily made and is not the result of force, threats or\npromises (other than the promises set forth in this plea agreement . . .).\u201d ROA, Vol. I\nat 177. Above Ms. Zayas\u2019s signature, the following paragraph appeared:\nThis agreement has been read to me in the language I understand best,\nand I have carefully discussed every part of it with my attorney. I\nunderstand the terms of this agreement, and I voluntarily agree to those\nterms. My attorney has advised me of my rights, of possible\ndefenses, . . . and of the consequences of entering into this\nagreement. . . . Finally, I am satisfied with the representation of my\nattorney in this matter.\nROA, Vol. I at 178.\nAt the plea hearing, the district court began by referencing the Information and\nconfirming that Ms. Zayas understood she would be pleading guilty to the charges set\nforth in that document. After reviewing the maximum penalties for the charge and\nMs. Zayas\u2019s waiver of indictment, the district court turned to the plea agreement.\nMs. Zayas acknowledged that she had read the plea agreement before she signed it,\nhad a chance to discuss the agreement with her attorneys, and understood its terms.\nThe district court also confirmed with Ms. Zayas that she understood the rights she\nwas giving up by entering a plea. Then, the district court had the government read the\n5factual basis from the plea agreement. Finally, the district court asked Ms. Zayas to\ntell the court \u201cin [her] own words why you think you\u2019re guilty of what you\u2019ve just\npled to.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 212. Ms. Zayas gave the following response:\nBecause I should have known. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know that Anna\nhad rib fractures. I didn\u2019t know that Anna had wrist fractures. I didn\u2019t\nknow that Anna had a skull fracture. But -- and even though I have that\n-- that -- that conviction in me and that\u2019s what has -- that along with my\nknowing that she was not murdered, has kept me fighting all of this [sic]\nyears.\nBut when the language says that I should have known . . . my\nlanguage used -- I used to say how could I? If I had known, I would\nhave . . . I would have helped my child, I would have seen. I would have\n-- if I had known . . . things could be different. But I didn\u2019t. But the\nlanguage says that I should have known because I am her parent. She\u2019s\nalive. And that -- that -- the -- the gross -- the injuries and how they\nhave -- could have occurred, even if accidental, was still negligent\nbecause it wasn\u2019t addressed. And so, although I never intended for Anna\nto be hurt, although I had another child afterwards and raised her with\nno injuries, I cannot deny that these injuries were, indeed, found.\nSo -- so I hurt for her. I wish I could have known, but I . . . and I\nshould have known, because I\u2019m her mommy. And so that\u2019s how I\u2019ve\nbeen able to -- the language is hard to stomach. It always -- it always\nwas, but I should have known. And I feel bad about that. I feel horrible.\nROA, Vol. I at 212\u201313 (ellipses in original).\nIn November 2015, Ms. Zayas\u2019s counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel\nand a motion written by Ms. Zayas to withdraw her guilty plea. At a hearing on\nFebruary 2, 2016, the district court granted counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. The\ndistrict court also determined Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea was knowingly and voluntarily made\nbut withheld a final ruling on Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her plea until new\ncounsel could review it. In October 2016, Ms. Zayas\u2019s new counsel filed a\nsupplemental and an amended supplemental motion to withdraw Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty\n6plea. As relevant to this appeal, Ms. Zayas argued she should be permitted to\nwithdraw her plea because the district court failed to adequately explain the nature of\nthe charge, including the recklessness mens rea requirement. Concluding that the\nInformation adequately informed Ms. Zayas of the recklessness requirement and that\nthe admission of facts in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea agreement satisfied this requirement, the\ndistrict court denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea on February 8,\n2017.\nIn December 2017, Ms. Zayas filed a motion to reconsider the denial of her\nmotion to withdraw her guilty plea on unrelated grounds. At the hearing on the\nmotion to reconsider, the district court sua sponte raised the concern that the court\nhad not sufficiently explained the elements of the charge to Ms. Zayas during the\nplea colloquy. After receiving additional briefing on this matter, the district court\nconcluded the language in the plea agreement put Ms. Zayas on notice that she was\npleading guilty to a crime with a recklessness mens rea and denied Ms. Zayas\u2019s\nmotion to reconsider. On September 28, 2018, the district court entered judgment,\nsentencing Ms. Zayas to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ms. Zayas timely filed a notice\nof appeal.\nB. The Mens Rea Requirement for Child Abuse Under New Mexico Law\nMs. Zayas pleaded guilty to child abuse resulting in great bodily harm in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 13 and N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-6-1(D)(1), (D)(2), and (E).\nUnder New Mexico law, \u201c[a]buse of a child consists of a person knowingly,\nintentionally or negligently, and without justifiable cause, causing or permitting a\n7child to be: (1) placed in a situation that may endanger the child\u2019s life or health; [or]\n(2) tortured, cruelly confined or cruelly punished.\u201d N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-6-1(D)(1)-\n(2). \u201cNegligently\u201d in this context \u201crefers to criminal negligence and means that a\nperson knew or should have known of the danger involved and acted with a reckless\ndisregard for the safety or health of the child.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30-6-1(A)(3).\nAt the time Ms. Zayas entered her guilty plea, the New Mexico Supreme Court\nhad interpreted the \u201cknew or should have known\u201d language in \u00a7 30-6-1 to \u201cevince[] a\nlegislative intent to use the concept of criminal negligence, not recklessness, as the\nstandard for negligent child abuse.\u201d State v. Schoonmaker, 176 P.3d 1105, 1117\n(N.M. 2008), overruled by State v. Consaul, 332 P.3d 850 (N.M. 2014). New\nMexico\u2019s uniform jury instruction for child abuse included the same \u201cknew or should\nhave known\u201d mens rea requirement:\nThe defendant acted [intentionally] [or] [with reckless disregard] [and\nwithout justification]. [To find that _______ (name of defendant) acted\nwith reckless disregard, you must find that _______ (name of defendant)\nknew or should have known the defendant\u2019s conduct created a\nsubstantial and foreseeable risk, the defendant disregarded that risk and\nthe defendant was wholly indifferent to the consequences of the conduct\nand to the welfare and safety of _______ (name of child)].\nN.M. Uniform Jury Instruction 14\u2013602 (repealed Apr. 3, 2015) (footnotes omitted).\nSix months after Ms. Zayas entered her guilty plea, but before the court\nentered judgment on her plea, the New Mexico Supreme Court sua sponte expressed\nsignificant concerns about the child abuse jury instruction and the court\u2019s prior\ninterpretation of the mens rea requirement for child abuse. Consaul, 332 P.3d at 855.\nIn State v. Consaul, the New Mexico Supreme Court recognized that the New Mexico\n8\u201cLegislature appeared to capture two standards of mens rea in one sentence when it\ndefined \u2018negligently\u2019 as meaning \u2018that a person knew or should have known of the\ndanger involved and acted with a reckless disregard for the safety or health of the\nchild\u2019\u201d because \u201cthe statute refers to both ordinary negligence and criminal\nrecklessness all in a single legislative breath.\u201d Id. at 858 (quoting N.M. Stat. Ann.\n\u00a7 30-6-1(A)(3)).\nThe New Mexico Supreme Court determined \u201c[t]he Legislature cannot\nrationally have intended such self-contradiction,\u201d and concluded \u201cthe Legislature\nintended the term \u2018reckless disregard\u2019 to prevail when \u2018knew or should have known\u2019\nconflicts.\u201d Id. The New Mexico Supreme Court reasoned, \u201cThe Legislature intended\nto punish acts done with a reckless state of mind consistent with its objective of\npunishing morally culpable acts and not mere inadvertence.\u201d Id. at 857. The court\nnoted that recklessness typically \u201crequire[s] an actor to consciously disregard a\nsubstantial and unjustifiable risk of such a nature and degree that its disregard\ninvolves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person\nwould observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d Id. at 857\u201358.\nAs a result, the New Mexico Supreme Court \u201cexpressly modif[ied] prior cases,\nincluding [its] own, in which courts have held that recklessness is not the culpability\nrequired for the crime of negligent child abuse.\u201d Id. at 858. To clarify that the\nrequisite mens rea for child abuse is recklessness, the court relabeled \u201ccriminally\nnegligent child abuse\u201d to \u201c\u2018reckless child abuse\u2019 without any reference to\nnegligence.\u201d Id. at 857. The court also \u201cspecifically overrule[d] that portion of\n9Schoonmaker in which [it] stated that \u2018Section 30-6-1 evinces a legislative intent to\nuse the concept of criminal negligence, not recklessness, as the standard for negligent\nchild abuse.\u2019\u201d Id. at 858 (quoting Schoonmaker, 176 P.3d at 1117).\nSince Consaul, New Mexico has updated its uniform jury instruction for child\nabuse resulting in great bodily harm. The instruction no longer includes the statutory\nlanguage \u201cknew or should have known,\u201d and it now explains the recklessness mens\nrea requirement:\n________ (name of defendant) showed a reckless disregard [without\njustification] for the safety or health of ________ (name of child). To\nfind that ________ (name of defendant) showed a reckless disregard,\nyou must find that _________ (name of defendant)\u2019s conduct was more\nthan merely negligent or careless. Rather, you must find that ________\n(name of defendant) [caused] [or] [permitted] a substantial and\nunjustifiable risk of serious harm to the safety or health of _______\n(name of child). A substantial and unjustifiable risk is one that any\nlaw-abiding person would recognize under similar circumstances and\nthat would cause any law-abiding person to behave differently than\n________ (name of defendant) out of concern for the safety or health of\n_______ (name of child).\nN.M. Uniform Jury Instruction 14\u2013615 (footnotes omitted).\nII. DISCUSSION\nOn appeal, Ms. Zayas asserts her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary\nbecause the district court failed to explain adequately the nature of the charge,\nincluding the recklessness mens rea requirement.\nA. Standard of Review\nWe review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for\nabuse of discretion. United States v. Marceleno, 819 F.3d 1267, 1272 (10th Cir.\n102016). As part of that analysis, we review de novo whether the plea was knowing and\nvoluntary. Id. \u201cAlthough a motion to withdraw a guilty plea should be freely allowed,\nwe will not reverse a district court\u2019s denial of such a motion unless it acted unjustly\nor unfairly.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB. Analysis\n\u201cA defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty . . . after the court accepts the\nplea, but before it imposes sentence if . . . the defendant can show a fair and just\nreason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(d). To determine whether\na defendant has met this burden, district courts consider seven factors: \u201c(1) whether\nthe defendant has asserted his innocence, (2) prejudice to the government, (3) delay\nin filing defendant\u2019s motion, (4) inconvenience to the court, (5) defendant\u2019s\nassistance of counsel, (6) whether the plea is knowing and voluntary, and (7) waste of\njudicial resources.\u201d Marceleno, 819 F.3d at 1272 (quotation marks omitted).\nAlthough whether the plea is knowing and voluntary is only one of these factors, \u201c[a]\nguilty plea is void if it is not knowing and voluntary.\u201d United States v. Gigley, 213\nF.3d 509, 516 (10th Cir. 2000). Accordingly, if we conclude that Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty\nplea was not knowing and voluntary, we may grant relief without separately\nconsidering the other Marceleno factors.\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 \u201cis designed to assist the district judge\nin making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant\u2019s plea is truly\nvoluntary.\u201d United States v. Ferrel, 603 F.3d 758, 762 (10th Cir. 2010) (quotation\nmarks omitted). Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b), a district court\n11accepting a guilty plea must \u201cinform the defendant of, and determine the defendant\nunderstands,\u201d certain information regarding the plea, including \u201cthe nature of each\ncharge to which the defendant is pleading.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(1)(G). \u201cIn most\ncases, this requires the court to recite the elements of the offense.\u201d Ferrel, 603 F.3d\nat 762.\nThe district court expressly acknowledged that it did not recite the elements of\nthe offense as required under Rule 11(b)(1)(G). To establish that a defendant\u2019s guilty\nplea was not knowing and involuntary because the district court failed to recite the\nelements of the offense, the defendant must\n(1) show that the [intent] element was a critical element of [the charge];\n(2) overcome the presumption that his attorney explained this element to\nhim at some other time prior to his guilty plea; and (3) demonstrate that,\nprior to his guilty plea, he did not receive notice of this element from\nany other source.\nAllen v. Mullin, 368 F.3d 1220, 1241 (10th Cir. 2004) (alterations in original)\n(quotation marks omitted). With respect to the second requirement, this court \u201cwill\nnot indulge the presumption unless there is factual basis in the record to support it.\u201d\nId.\nThe government concedes that the mens rea element is a critical element of the\ncharged crime. Thus, to determine if Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary,\nwe analyze (1) the presumption that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorney informed her of the\nrecklessness mens rea requirement, and (2) the availability of information about the\nmens rea requirement from other sources.\n12The Presumption Ms. Zayas\u2019s Attorney Informed Ms. Zayas of the Mens Rea\nRequirement\nThe presumption that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorney informed her of the recklessness\nmens rea requirement is appropriate only when \u201cthere is factual basis in the record to\nsupport it.\u201d Allen, 368 F.3d at 1241. The government argues there is a factual basis in\nthe record to support the presumption because Ms. Zayas and her counsel\nacknowledged in the plea agreement and during the plea colloquy that they had\nreviewed her possible defenses. The government asserts that a conversation about\nMs. Zayas\u2019s possible defenses \u201cwould have had to include a discussion of the mens\nrea to commit the crime.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 17. Because the jury instructions at the time of\nMs. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea included language about reckless disregard, the government\nargues the court can \u201cpresume[] that [Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys] informed [her] of the\nreckless-disregard requirement.\u201d Id. The government also points to the recklessness\nlanguage in the plea agreement\u2019s factual basis and argues that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys\n\u201cwould not have wanted her to make [a recklessness admission] if they had believed\nthe government need only prove negligence.\u201d Id. We are not convinced.\nAt the time Ms. Zayas pleaded guilty, her attorneys had no notice that the\ngovernment would be required to prove recklessness instead of criminal negligence.\nThe New Mexico Supreme Court had reviewed the language of the child abuse jury\ninstruction and concluded that \u201cthe concept of criminal negligence, not recklessness,\u201d\nprovides \u201cthe standard for negligent child abuse.\u201d Schoonmaker, 176 P.3d at 1117.\nAfter Ms. Zayas entered her guilty plea, the New Mexico Supreme Court overruled\n13its precedent and held that the requisite mens rea for child abuse is recklessness.\nConsaul, 332 P.3d at 857\u201358. Because the mens rea requirement at the time\nMs. Zayas entered her guilty plea was criminal negligence, there is no reason to\npresume from the record that her attorneys adequately informed her of the\nrecklessness requirement that she consciously disregarded a known risk, rather than\nthe negligence requirement that she should have known of the risk.\nAt most, Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys would have informed her of the criminal\nnegligence standard and explained that the government must prove that she \u201cknew or\nshould have known\u201d of a substantial foreseeable risk and disregarded that risk. N.M.\nUniform Jury Instruction 14\u2013602 (emphasis added). Her attorneys would have had no\nreason to object to the reckless disregard language in the plea agreement\u2019s factual\nbasis because it mirrored the reckless disregard language in the child abuse jury\ninstruction. And there is no evidence in the record that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys would\nhave had any reason to predict that the New Mexico Supreme Court would overrule\nits precedent on the mens rea requirement. Accordingly, there is no factual basis in\nthe record to support a presumption that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys adequately informed\nher of the recklessness mens rea requirement.\nAvailability of Information Regarding the Mens Rea Requirement from Any\nOther Source\nTo prevail, Ms. Zayas must also demonstrate that she did not learn of the\nrecklessness mens rea element from another source. Allen, 368 F.3d at 1241. To\ndetermine whether a defendant had notice of the element prior to her plea, this court\n14considers the Information, plea agreement, and plea colloquy. See, e.g., Ferrel, 603\nF.3d at 763\u201364. We consider each of these items now, concluding that none of them\nnotified Ms. Zayas of the recklessness mens rea element.\nThe Information does just the opposite, charging that Ms. Zayas \u201cdid\nnegligently, and without justifiable cause, cause and permit Jane Doe #1, a child, to\nbe placed in a situation that may endanger Jane Doe #1\u2019s life and health, and to be\ntortured and to be cruelly punished, which resulted in great bodily harm to Jane Doe\n#1.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 170 (emphasis added). As the government conceded at oral\nargument, this language embodies a criminal negligence standard. There is no\nlanguage in the Information that would have put Ms. Zayas on notice that the\ngovernment would be required to prove recklessness\u2014that she consciously\ndisregarded a known risk.\nTurning now to the plea agreement, we conclude it likewise fails to evidence\nMs. Zayas\u2019s understanding that recklessness was required. Ms. Zayas admitted:\nI knew or should have known that my conduct created a substantial and\nforeseeable risk that my daughter, Annalicia Zayas, would be physically\nharmed or killed. I disregarded that risk, and I was wholly indifferent to\nthe consequences of the conduct and to the welfare and safety of my\ndaughter, Annalicia Zayas.\nROA Vol. I at 175\u201376.\nThe government emphasizes the second sentence\u2014that Ms. Zayas disregarded\n\u201cthat risk\u201d and was \u201cwholly indifferent to the consequences of the conduct.\u201d\nAccording to the government, this \u201cis the same language discussed and endorsed by\nthe New Mexico Supreme Court in Consaul to define \u2018reckless disregard.\u2019\u201d Gov\u2019t Br.\n15at 18. The government further argues that the negligence language in the first\nsentence\u2014that she knew or should have known\u2014\u201cwas at most surplusage that did\nnot negate the presence of the recklessness language.\u201d Id. In other words, the\ngovernment contends that Ms. Zayas agreed she acted both negligently and\nrecklessly. In denying Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to reconsider, the district court agreed\nwith this reading of the plea agreement:\nWhile it is true that the Plea Agreement also contains the\nconfusing \u201cknew or should have known\u201d language that the New Mexico\nSupreme Court has disavowed, it was supplemental to the remaining\nlanguage in the Plea Agreement, which clearly indicates a recklessness\nmens rea and was sufficient to put Ms. Zayas on notice that she was\nalso pleading guilty to acting recklessly.\nROA, Vol. I at 443 (citation omitted); see also ROA, Vol. I at 315 (denying Ms.\nZayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea and determining \u201c[t]he factual basis to\nwhich Ms. Zayas admitted included the recklessness element of the offense\u201d).\nAgain, we disagree. The language in the plea agreement\u2019s factual basis\nmirrored the language in the pre-Consaul jury instruction. In Consaul, the New\nMexico Supreme Court expressly rejected that language as inadequately and\nconfusingly defining \u201creckless disregard.\u201d See Consaul, 332 P.3d at 856\u201358. The\ncourt clarified that recklessness, not negligence, was the proper mens rea for child\nabuse, and that recklessness typically \u201crequire[s] an actor to consciously disregard a\nsubstantial and unjustifiable risk of such a nature and degree that its disregard\ninvolves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person\nwould observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d Id. at 857\u201358.\n16Like the jury instruction struck down by the New Mexico Supreme Court, the\nplea agreement indicates that Ms. Zayas \u201cknew or should have known that [her]\nconduct created a substantial and foreseeable risk that [Annalicia] would be\nphysically harmed or killed.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 175. As part of the plea agreement,\nMs. Zayas admits she \u201cdisregarded that risk [and] was wholly indifferent to the\nconsequences of the conduct,\u201d but she does so only for a risk of which she \u201cknew or\nshould have known.\u201d ROA, Vol. I at 175. Ms. Zayas does not admit in the plea\nagreement that she consciously disregarded such a risk. See ROA, Vol. I at 175. And\nthe conflicting \u201cknew or should have known\u201d language does not notify Ms. Zayas\nthat the government was required to prove she consciously disregarded a risk\u2014\nsomething she could have done only if she knew of the risk\u2014rather than prove\nMs. Zayas disregarded a risk of which she should have known.\nAnd nothing in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea colloquy indicates she received notice of the\nrecklessness mens rea requirement from any other source. To the contrary, she states\nrepeatedly that she should have known of the risk and emphasizes that she did not\nknow of that risk:\nBecause I should have known. I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know that Anna\nhad rib fractures. I didn\u2019t know that Anna had wrist fractures. I didn\u2019t\nknow that Anna had a skull fracture. . . .\nBut when the language says that I should have known . . . my\nlanguage used -- I used to say how could I? If I had known, I would\nhave . . . I would have helped my child, I would have seen. I would have\n-- if I had known . . . things could be different. But I didn\u2019t. But the\nlanguage says that I should have known because I am her parent. She\u2019s\nalive. And that -- that -- the -- the gross -- the injuries and how they\nhave -- could have occurred, even if accidental, was still negligent\nbecause it wasn\u2019t addressed. . . .\n17So -- so I hurt for her. I wish I could have known, but I . . . and I\nshould have known, because I\u2019m her mommy. And so that\u2019s how I\u2019ve\nbeen able to -- the language is hard to stomach. It always -- it always\nwas, but I should have known. And I feel bad about that. I feel horrible.\nROA, Vol. I at 212\u201313 (emphases added).\nThere is nothing in the Information or the plea agreement indicating the\ngovernment would be required to prove that Ms. Zayas knew rather than should have\nknown of the risk. In fact, at the time of Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea, the government\nwould not have been required to prove more than criminal negligence. The use of\n\u201cshould have known\u201d in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea agreement and the plea colloquy was not\nsuperfluous to the other reckless disregard language; it was an alternative basis for\nguilt. The should-have-known language in the plea agreement allowed the\ngovernment to prove negligence when the defendant disregarded a risk of which she\nshould have known. Later developments in New Mexico law make it clear that the\nshould-have-known standard is no longer good law. And Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea colloquy\nemphatically confirms that she believed the government could prove its case because\nshe should have known of the risk.\nIn sum, the record reflects that Ms. Zayas was not aware of the specific\nrequirements of the recklessness element\u2014that she consciously disregarded a known\nrisk. There is nothing in the Information, plea agreement, or plea colloquy that would\nsupport the conclusion that Ms. Zayas received notice of the recklessness mens rea\nrequirement from another source. Indeed, the Information that sets forth the criminal\ncharge to which she pleaded guilty states only a negligence mens rea. Upon this\n18record, we conclude Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because\nshe was not informed of the elements of the offense to which she pleaded guilty.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nBecause there is no factual basis in the record to support the presumption that\nMs. Zayas\u2019s attorneys explained the recklessness mens rea requirement to her, and\nthere is no evidence in the record that she received notice of the recklessness mens\nrea requirement from any other source, Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea was not knowing and\nvoluntary. Therefore, the district court abused its discretion in denying Ms. Zayas\u2019s\nmotion to withdraw her guilty plea. We VACATE the judgment, REVERSE the\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea, and\nREMAND for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\nEntered for the Court\nCarolyn B. McHugh\nCircuit Judge\n19",

Daleo,\nDefendant-Appellant. ) Judge, presiding.\nJUSTICE HYMAN delivered the judgment of the court.\nPresiding Justice Griffin and Justice Walker concurred in the judgment.\nORDER\n\u00b6 1 Held: The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting an officer\u2019s out-of-court\nstatement because it was not hearsay. Thus, defendant was not denied a fair trial\nwhen the prosecutor referred to the statement in closing argument as proof of\ndefendant\u2019s identity as the offender.\n\u00b6 2 A jury convicted Trevor Anderson on one count of aggravated fleeing or attempting to\nelude a police officer and one count of driving while his license was revoked. On appeal, Anderson\nargues the State\u2019s closing argument deprived him of a fair trial because the prosecutor relied on\nimproperly admitted hearsay testimony. We affirm. The statement was not hearsay under IllinoisNo. 1-17-1665\nRule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015), and because the statement does not constitute\nhearsay, the prosecutor could refer to it in closing argument.\n\u00b6 3 Background\n\u00b6 4 By indictment, Anderson was charged with multiple offenses arising from an incident on\nMarch 10, 2014. The State proceeded on one count of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a\npolice officer (625 ILCS 5/11-204.1(a)(4), (b) (West 2014)), and one count of driving while his\ndriver\u2019s license, permit, or privilege to operate a motor vehicle was suspended or revoked (625\nILCS 5/6-303(a) (West Supp. 2013)).\n\u00b6 5 Before trial, the State filed a motion in limine to admit Maywood police officer George\nAdamidis\u2019s out-of-court statement made while stopping Anderson for driving while with a revoked\nlicense. According to the State, as Adamidis approached Anderson\u2019s car, he saw Anderson reach\ntowards the gearshift. Anticipating Anderson would drive away, Adamidis said, \u201cTrevor, don\u2019t do\nit.\u201d The State argued the statement showed Anderson\u2019s willfulness in fleeing and did not fall within\nthe hearsay exception because it merely involved a \u201cstatement of direction.\u201d At the hearing on the\nmotion, the State added that the statement constituted an excited utterance and did not contain an\n\u201cassertion of fact.\u201d Anderson objected, contending that the statement qualifies as hearsay and\nidentified Anderson as the offender, which would bolster Adamidis\u2019s in-court testimony that he\ncurbed the car because he recognized Anderson. The court confirmed with the State that Adamidis\nwould testify he recognized Anderson from encounters and granted the motion to admit the\nstatement without further explanation.\n\u00b6 6 At trial, Maywood police officer George Rangel testified that on March 10, 2014, he was\non patrol with Adamidis driving eastbound on Adams Street towards Ninth Avenue. As the officers\n- 2 -No. 1-17-1665\napproached a stop sign, Rangel saw a sedan driving northbound on Ninth and recognized the driver\nas Anderson, whom he knew through contacts had a suspended or revoked license. The officers\nactivated their emergency equipment and followed Anderson as he turned right. Anderson traveled\na block before being pulled over.\n\u00b6 7 The officers stopped behind Anderson. As they walked toward the rear of Anderson\u2019s car,\nAnderson moved to put it into drive and Adamidis \u201cyelled [,] don\u2019t do it, Trevor.\u201d Anderson then\ndrove away. The officers followed Anderson with their emergency equipment activated.\nEventually, the officers lost sight of Anderson and terminated their chase.\n\u00b6 8 While on patrol a couple months later, on June 3, Rangel saw Anderson in a car and\nAnderson saw Rangel. Anderson got out and began walking towards his home. Rangel radioed\nother units to set up a perimeter and Anderson was arrested later that day.\n\u00b6 9 On cross-examination, Rangel testified that on March 10, he saw Anderson\u2019s face for \u201c[a]\nfew seconds\u201d when Anderson\u2019s car was moving, and saw the \u201ctop of his face\u201d through the rearview\nmirror on Anderson\u2019s car when Anderson\u2019s car stopped. As Rangel approached the rear\npassenger\u2019s side, he saw Darius Blackwell, who looked backwards at Rangel, in the passenger\u2019s\nseat. Anderson was not the registered owner, and Rangel did not contact him or the registered\nowner following the incident.\n\u00b6 10 Adamidis testified consistently with Rangel about the March 10 stop. Adamidis recognized\nAnderson as the driver they curbed and stated that about a minute passed between when they saw\nAnderson and when he stopped. Adamidis last encountered Anderson two months earlier, and\nknew his license was revoked. When Adamidis approached, he saw Anderson use his right hand\nto place the car in drive, and \u201cyelled out loud [,] don\u2019t do it, Trevor.\u201d\n- 3 -No. 1-17-1665\n\u00b6 11 On cross-examination, Adamidis said he did not contact Anderson or the registered owner\nof the car. In his incident report, he did not include that Blackwell was in the car because Anderson\n\u201cwas the only offender.\u201d Adamidis stated that he approached the rear bumper on the driver\u2019s side\nand saw Anderson through the side mirror. He did not recall testifying at a preliminary hearing\nthat he approached from the rear passenger\u2019s side.\n\u00b6 12 The State produced a certified record showing that on March 10, 2014, Anderson\u2019s driver\u2019s\nlicense was revoked.\n\u00b6 13 Anderson entered a stipulation that if called, June Dakuras, a certified shorthand reporter,\nwould testify that she transcribed Adamidis\u2019s testimony at a preliminary hearing. Adamidis stated\nhe was \u201cunable to reach\u201d the driver\u2019s side window of Anderson\u2019s car, but \u201ccame to the rear\npassenger\u2019s side.\u201d Anderson also produced a certified copy of the registration of the car officers\nfollowed on March 10, 2014, which showed that Anderson was not the registered owner.\n\u00b6 14 Jasmine Wiley, Anderson\u2019s fianc\u00e9, testified that she and Anderson were at their home on\nJune 3, 2014. In the afternoon, Wiley drove them to her doctor\u2019s appointment in a rental car.\nAround 5 p.m., they came home. As Wiley parked, a police car driving the wrong way down a\none-way street slowed down alongside her. She and Anderson got out of the rental car and entered\nthe house. Inside, Wiley looked out the window and saw officers surrounding the car. Wiley sent\nAnderson to find out what was going on. She next heard a \u201cloud commotion like a bunch of\nscreaming,\u201d went outside, and saw Anderson lying on the ground in the driveway. On cross-\nexamination, Wiley testified that Anderson knew Blackwell.\n- 4 -No. 1-17-1665\n\u00b6 15 In closing, the State argued that Anderson\u2019s identity as the driver curbed by Rangel and\nAdamidis on March 10, 2014, was shown through their testimony that they recognized him. The\nState said:\n\u201cWhat did *** Adamidis say right before Trevor took off? He said, \u2018Don\u2019t do it, Trevor.\u2019\nHe testified to that. Rangel also testified to that. That was an excited utterance. \u2018Don\u2019t do\nit, Trevor.\u2019 He knew it was Trevor. He shouted his name out.\u201d\nThe State posited that Adamidis\u2019s statement on approaching the car served as a \u201ctruth detector***\u201d\nfor the identification of Anderson as the offender.\n\u00b6 16 In response, defense counsel countered that the officers\u2019 testimony failed to satisfy the\nState\u2019s burden to prove Anderson committed the alleged offense. In rebuttal, the State again\nemphasized that Anderson and the officers knew each other, and that Adamidis yelled out\nAnderson\u2019s name when approaching the vehicle.\n\u00b6 17 The trial court then provided jury instructions. Relevant here, the court admonished the\njury that \u201c[n]either opening statements or closing arguments are evidence, and any statement or\nargument made by the attorneys which is not based on the evidence should be disregarded.\u201d The\ncourt also provided the jury with factors relevant to weighing the identification testimony of a\nwitness, such as the witness\u2019s opportunity to view the offender during the offense, the witness\u2019s\ndegree of attention during the offense, the witness\u2019s level of certainty, and the time between the\noffense and the identification confrontation.\n\u00b6 18 During deliberations, the jury sent the trial court two notes. First, the jury asked, \u201cWhat is\nthe next step if we are split in our opinion?\u201d By agreement of the parties, the court instructed the\njury to continue deliberating. Second, the jury asked, \u201cIs there guidance for what constitutes\n- 5 -No. 1-17-1665\npositive identification beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d The court again responded that the jury should\ncontinue deliberating.\n\u00b6 19 The jury found Anderson guilty of aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer\nand aggravated driving while his license was revoked. Anderson filed a posttrial motion, arguing\nthe State failed to prove his identity as the offender beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court\ndenied Anderson\u2019s motion.\n\u00b6 20 After a hearing, the trial court sentenced Anderson to concurrent terms of five years\u2019\nimprisonment on each count. Anderson filed a motion to reconsider sentence. The court\nresentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment for aggravated driving.\n\u00b6 21 Analysis\n\u00b6 22 Anderson argues the State\u2019s closing argument denied him a fair trial because Adamidis\u2019s\nout-of-court statement, \u201cdon\u2019t do it, Trevor,\u201d was not an excited utterance and was only admissible\nto show Anderson ignored a police command, not for the truth of the matter asserted\u2014that\nAnderson was the offender.\n\u00b6 23 Initially, Anderson concedes that he did not properly preserve this issue for appeal. A\ndefendant must object both at trial and in a written posttrial motion to preserve for review. People\nv. Reese, 2017 IL 120011, \u00b6 60. Although Anderson objected to the admission of the statement\nbefore trial, he failed to object to the State\u2019s use of the statement in closing argument and did not\nchallenge the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling or the State\u2019s closing argument in his posttrial motion.\nSo, Anderson has forfeited review.\n\u00b6 24 Instead, Anderson asserts that his claim may be reviewed for plain error. Under the plain\nerror doctrine, the appellate court may review a forfeited claim when a clear or obvious error\n- 6 -No. 1-17-1665\noccurred, and either (i) \u201cthe evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip\nthe scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error,\u201d or (ii) \u201cthat\nerror is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant\u2019s trial and challenged the integrity\nof the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\u201d People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill.\n2d 551, 565 (2007). Anderson contends the first prong applies.\n\u00b6 25 Was there Error?\n\u00b6 26 Initially, we must determine whether an error occurred. People v. Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d\n598, 613 (2010). We begin our analysis with the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling.\n\u00b6 27 The trial court overruled Anderson\u2019s hearsay objection without identifying the basis of its\nruling\u2014whether the testimony contains hearsay and, if it does, what exception applied. Since we\nmay affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling on any basis supported in the record (People v. Dinelli, 217 Ill. 2d\n387, 403 (2005), we examine whether the testimony presents hearsay.\n\u00b6 28 The United States and Illinois Constitutions guarantee a defendant the right to confront\nwitnesses. U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV; Ill. Const. 1970, art. I, \u00a7 8. Hearsay is a statement, other\nthan one made by the declarant while testifying, \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the\nmatter asserted.\u201d Ill. Evid. R. 801(c) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015). A statement does not trigger hearsay if,\n\u201c[i]n a criminal case, the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-\nexamination concerning the statement, and the statement is *** one of identification of a person\nmade after perceiving the person.\u201d Ill. Evid. R. 801(d)(1)(B) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015).\n\u00b6 29 The admission of evidence falls within the sound discretion of the trial court. People v.\nBecker, 239 Ill. 2d 215, 234 (2010). We only reverse a decision to admit evidence if the trial court\nabused its discretion. Id. Adamidis testified and was subject to cross-examination at trial over his\n- 7 -No. 1-17-1665\nout-of-court statement, \u201cdon\u2019t do it, Trevor,\u201d which he made immediately after recognizing\nAnderson as the driver he pulled over. This qualifies the statement as admissible under Illinois\nRule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) (eff. Oct. 15, 2015).\n\u00b6 30 Anderson also contends that the prosecutor committed reversible error in closing argument\nby repeating the out-of-court statement as proof of Anderson\u2019s identity as the offender. Anderson\nasserts that because the statement was not an excited utterance, it was only admissible to show that\nAnderson willfully ignored Adamidis\u2019s command, but the State used it to bolster the officers\u2019\ntestimony that Anderson drove the sedan. According to Anderson, the closeness of the evidence\nmakes this highly prejudicial as evidenced by the jury sending the court two notes. But the\nstatement not amounting to hearsay means that the prosecutor could refer to it in closing argument.\nSee People v. Reed, 108 Ill. App. 3d 984, 993 (1982) (prosecutor\u2019s reference to properly admitted\nexhibit in closing argument was proper).\n\u00b6 31 Finally, there being no error, we need not discuss Anderson\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness for\nhis counsel\u2019s failing (i) to object during closing arguments to the State\u2019s reference to Adamidis\u2019s\nstatement and (ii) to include the issue in a posttrial motion. See People v. Land, 2011 IL App (1st)\n101048, \u00b6 146 (declining to consider ineffective claim where no error).\n\u00b6 32 Affirmed.\n- 8 -",

(PIP) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of\ndefendants Maryellis Bunn and 1AND8, Inc.\u2019s Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n12(b)(6) motion to dismiss PIP\u2019s copyright infringement action. Because the\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The panel unanimously concludes this case is suitable for decision\nwithout oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2).parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recount them here. We have\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.\nWe review de novo the grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss as well as\nlegal determinations, such as the appropriate scope of copyright protection.\nRentmeester v. Nike, Inc., 883 F.3d 1111, 1116 (9th Cir. 2018). We review for\nabuse of discretion a district court\u2019s dismissal without leave to amend. Id. at 1125.\nTo state a claim for copyright infringement, PIP must plausibly allege: (1)\nthat it owns a valid copyright in the Design Proposal, and (2) that defendants\ncopied protected aspects of PIP\u2019s expression. Id. at 1116\u201317. \u201c[T]he second\nelement has two distinct components: \u2018copying\u2019 and \u2018unlawful appropriation.\u2019\u201d Id.\nat 1117 (quoting Sid & Marty Krofft Television Prods., Inc. v. McDonald\u2019s Corp.,\n562 F.2d 1157, 1164\u201365 (9th Cir. 1977)). To prove unlawful appropriation, PIP\nmust show that \u201cthe similarities between the two works [are] substantial and . . .\ninvolve protected elements of [its] work.\u201d Id. (internal quotations omitted). This\ninvolves a two-part analysis consisting of an \u201cextrinsic test\u201d and an \u201cintrinsic test.\u201d\nId. at 1118. PIP must satisfy both, but \u201c[o]nly the extrinsic test\u2019s application may\nbe decided by the court as a matter of law.\u201d Id.\nThe district court properly concluded that the unicorn depiction over which\nPIP asserted copyright protection did not contain the \u201cquantum of originality\n2needed to merit copyright protection,\u201d because it depicts a unicorn as the mythical\ncreature is often portrayed. See Satava v. Lowry, 323 F.3d 805, 811 (9th Cir.\n2003). The district court further properly concluded that, even if there were certain\ncopyrightable elements of PIP\u2019s design, the copyright protection would be \u201cthin,\u201d\nmeaning that protection would be afforded \u201cagainst only virtually identical\ncopying.\u201d Id. at 812. Given that the copyright protection here was\u2014at\nbest\u2014\u201cthin,\u201d and that there are notable differences between the unicorn and\nrainbow elements in the Design Proposal and those in the Rainbow Room, the\ndistrict court did not err in concluding that there was no infringement as a matter of\nlaw. The record supports the conclusion that there were \u201cdisparities that no\nordinary observer of the two works would be disposed to overlook.\u201d Rentmeester,\n883 F.3d at 1122.\nThe district court did not err by dismissing the case with prejudice because\nany further amendment to PIP\u2019s complaint would be futile. Copyright\ninfringement is not ordinarily resolved on the pleadings, and judgment as a matter\nof law on questions of substantial similarity is \u201cnot highly favored.\u201d L.A. Printex\nIndus.

Mark S. Davis, Chief District Judge. (2:15-cr-00024-MSD-LRL-1;\n2:17-cv-00584-MSD)\nSubmitted: February 3, 2020 Decided: February 10, 2020\nBefore AGEE and KEENAN, Circuit Judges, and TRAXLER, Senior Circuit Judge.\nDismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion.\nRonald Laverne Johns, Jr., Appellant Pro Se.\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM:\nRonald Laverne Johns, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief\non his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2018) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice\nor judge issues a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2018). A\ncertificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a\nconstitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2018). When the district court denies relief\non the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists\nwould find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\nSee Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773-74 (2017). When the district court denies relief on\nprocedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural\nruling is debatable and that the motion states a debatable claim of the denial of a\nconstitutional right. Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. 134, 140-41 (2012) (citing Slack v.\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)).\nWe have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Johns has not made\nthe requisite showing.* Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the\nappeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are\nadequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the\ndecisional process.\nDISMISSED\n* Johns has filed a motion to dismiss and remand his case on jurisdictional grounds\nbecause, he alleges, the district court did not rule on all of his habeas claims. Upon review,\nwe conclude that the court addressed and resolved all of Johns\u2019 claims. We therefore deny\nthe motion.\n2",

NELSON, Circuit Judges, and MOLLOY,**\nDistrict Judge.\nFormer employees of PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., appeal the district\ncourt\u2019s order compelling arbitration of their claims under the Federal Fair Labor\n* This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent\nexcept as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.\n* * The Honorable Donald W. Molloy, United States District Judge for\nthe District of Montana, sitting by designation.Standards Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201 et seq., and dismissing the action. We have\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)(3). See Green Tree Fin.\nCorp.-Ala. v. Randolph, 531 U.S. 79, 89 (2000); Interactive Flight Techs., Inc. v.\nSwissair Swiss Air Transp. Co., 249 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 2001). We hold that\nwe are bound by a decision of the California Court of Appeal holding that\nPennyMac\u2019s arbitration agreement is unenforceable in its entirety, and we therefore\nreverse.1\nThe district court compelled arbitration of the employees\u2019 FLSA claims,\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state-law claims,\ndismissed all claims before it, and entered judgment. The district court reasoned\nthat the employees\u2019 FLSA claims were arbitrable under Epic Systems Corp. v.\nLewis, 138 S. Ct. 1612 (2018), but it did not consider the employees\u2019 alternative\nargument that PennyMac\u2019s arbitration agreement was unenforceable because it\ncontained an unlawful waiver of representative claims under the California Private\nAttorneys General Act, Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2698 et seq., and that the waiver was\ninseverable from the remainder of the arbitration agreement. After the district\ncourt rendered its decision, the California Court of Appeal held in Smigelski v.\n1 PennyMac\u2019s motion for an order that the excerpts of record be\nsupplemented (Dkt. 41) is DENIED as moot.\n2PennyMac Financial Services, Inc., No. C081958, 2018 WL 6629406, at *12 (Cal.\nCt. App. Dec. 19, 2018) (unpublished), reh\u2019g denied (Jan. 9, 2019), review denied,\nS253796 (Cal. Apr. 10, 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 223 (2019), that\nPennyMac\u2019s arbitration agreement contains an unlawful and inseverable PAGA\nwaiver and that therefore \u201cPennyMac cannot compel arbitration of any of\nSmigelski\u2019s causes of action, including causes of action that would otherwise be\narbitrable.\u201d\nThe Full Faith and Credit Clause and its implementing statute require that\nfederal courts \u201cgive to a state-court judgment the same preclusive effect as would\nbe given that judgment under the law of the State in which the judgment was\nrendered.\u201d Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 81 (1984);\nRodriguez v. City of San Jose, 930 F.3d 1123, 1130 (9th Cir. 2019); see also U.S.\nConst. art. IV, \u00a7 1; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738. Under California law, issue preclusion\napplies against a party to a prior proceeding in which the issue to be precluded was\nactually litigated and necessarily decided in a final decision on the merits unless\nthe application of issue preclusion would be inconsistent with public policy. See\nWhite v. City of Pasadena, 671 F.3d 918, 927 (9th Cir. 2012) (citing Lucido v.\nSuperior Court, 795 P.2d 1223, 1225\u201327 (Cal. 1990)).\n3The requirements of issue preclusion under California law are met here.\nPennyMac was a party to the prior proceeding; identical arbitration agreements\nwere at issue; the parties vigorously litigated whether the agreements contained\nunenforceable PAGA waivers and whether those waivers were severable; the Court\nof Appeal expressly decided those issues; and its decision is final on appeal.\nPennyMac argues that the issues here differ from those decided in Smigelski\nbecause the employees here assert claims under federal law. We disagree. The\nCourt of Appeal in Smigelski held that the severability provisions of PennyMac\u2019s\narbitration agreement prohibited severance of provisions found to violate state law.\nSee 2018 WL 6629406, at *11. For that reason, the court held that the agreements\nwere unenforceable in their entirety, not only as to PAGA claims or to claims\nunder state law. See id. at *12. That PennyMac disagrees with the Court of\nAppeal\u2019s application of federal law is not a valid basis for refusing that decision\nfull faith and credit as required by \u00a7 1738. See Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90,\n95\u201396 (1980).\nThe district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\nemployees\u2019 state-law claims for the sole reason that it had dismissed all federal\nclaims before it. Because we reverse the district court\u2019s order dismissing the\nemployees\u2019 federal claims, we also reverse as to their state-law claims.\nREVERSED.\n4",

DESMOND,\nAppellant\n____________________________________\nOn Appeal from the United States District Court\nfor the District of Delaware\n(D.C. Civil Action No. 1-18-cv-01283)\nDistrict Judge: Honorable Maryellen Noreika\n____________________________________\nSubmitted Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\nFebruary 6, 2020\nBefore: SHWARTZ, RESTREPO, and RENDELL, Circuit Judges\n(Opinion filed: February 7, 2020)O P I N I O N*\n___________\nPER CURIAM\nPro se appellant Christopher Desmond appeals from the District Court\u2019s order\nsummarily remanding his case to state court. For the reasons that follow, we will\naffirm.\nDesmond filed a notice of removal with the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Delaware seeking removal of one or more criminal actions from Delaware\nstate court. After reviewing Desmond\u2019s removal petition, the District Court determined\nthat it appeared Desmond was attempting to remove his case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1443 and the removal procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455. The District Court then\nheld that the allegations in Desmond\u2019s notice were insufficient to support removal under\n\u00a7 1443, denied the petition, and summarily remanded the case to the state court from\nwhich it was removed. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4) (\u201cIf it clearly appears on the face of\nthe notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should not be permitted, the\ncourt shall make an order for summary remand.\u201d). Desmond timely appealed.\nThis Court may review a remand order in a case which was removed pursuant to\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). We exercise plenary review here. See\nLazorko v. Pa. Hosp., 237 F.3d 242, 247 (3d Cir. 2000). As explained by the District\n* This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7 does not\nconstitute binding precedent.\n2Court, the removal permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 is narrow. Section 1443(1) authorizes\nthe removal of a state law action \u201c[a]gainst any person who is denied or cannot enforce in\nthe courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of\ncitizens of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1443. For this provision to apply, \u201ca state court defendant must demonstrate both (1)\nthat he is being deprived of rights guaranteed by a federal law \u2018providing for . . . equal\ncivil rights\u2019; and (2) that he is \u2018denied or cannot enforce that right in the courts\u2019 of the\nstate.\u201d Davis v. Glanton, 107 F.3d 1044, 1047 (3d Cir. 1997) (quoting Georgia v. Rachel,\n384 U.S. 780, 788 (1966)). Under the first requirement, the defendant must allege a\ndeprivation of rights guaranteed by a federal law \u201cproviding for specific civil rights stated\nin terms of racial equality.\u201d Id. (internal citations and quotations omitted). Under the\nsecond requirement, removal is available where the defendant\u2019s federal civil rights would\n\u201cinevitably be denied by the very act of being brought to trial in state court.\u201d Id. at 1050.\n(internal citations and quotations omitted).\nThe District Court correctly determined that Desmond did not allege in his petition\nthat the state court litigation involves issues of racial inequality, and he offers no\nargument on appeal to dispute that determination. Thus, there does not appear to have\nbeen a valid basis for the removal, particularly at the post-conviction stage. See Johnson\nv. Mississippi, 421 U.S. 213, 219 (1975) (\u201cClaims that prosecution and conviction will\nviolate rights under constitutional or statutory provisions of general applicability or under\nstatutes not protecting against racial discrimination, will not suffice\u201d for removal of a\ncriminal prosecution). Desmond likewise failed to allege anything that might permit\n3removal under \u00a7 1443(2). Subparagraph (2) applies only to \u201cfederal officers or agents\nand those authorized to act with or for them in affirmatively executing duties under any\nfederal law providing for equal civil rights,\u201d City of Greenwood v. Peacock, 384 U.S.\n808, 824 (1966), and state officers who refuse to do an act on the ground that it would be\ninconsistent with civil rights laws. See Greenberg v. Veteran, 889 F.2d 418, 421 (2d Cir.\n1989) (\u201cThe purpose of \u2018refusal clause\u2019 is to provide a federal forum for suits against\nstate officers who uphold equal protection in the face of strong public disapproval.\u201d).\nDesmond is neither a federal nor state officer.\nWe further agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Desmond\u2019s reliance on\nAdams v. Governor of Delaware, 922 F.3d 166 (3d Cir. 2019), cert. granted, 2019 WL\n6647103 (U.S. Dec. 6, 2019) (No. 19-309), is misplaced. In Adams, this Court held that\nsections of the Delaware Constitution that required the number of judges to be balanced\nbetween the two major political parties violated the First Amendment right to freedom of\nassociation. See id. at 184\u201385. Desmond appears to argue that this means he has been\nconvicted in a proceeding presided over by a judge who had been unconstitutionally\nappointed. However, there is no language in Adams that implies that the judges\npreviously appointed under Delaware\u2019s political balance requirement are unqualified to\nserve as judicial officers, nor did the Court give any indication that its decision was\nintended to support an argument that all prior Delaware convictions be vacated. Cf.\nAdams, 922 F.3d at 186 (McKee, J., concurring) (\u201cPraise for the Delaware judiciary is\nnearly universal, and it is well deserved.\u201d). As such, Desmond\u2019s Adams argument does\nnot provide a valid basis for removal under \u00a7 1443.\n4Accordingly, the District Court correctly determined that removal under \u00a7 1443\nwould not be proper and appropriately remanded Desmond\u2019s case to the state court. See\n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4).1 We will thus affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n1 Moreover, we agree with the District Court\u2019s observation that the removal petition was\nnot timely filed. See id. at \u00a7 1455(b)(1).\n5",

Filed February 10, 2020.\nClaudia Yanira Magana, pro se.\nDaniel G. Kempland, Melissa D. Lang, and Gregory Michael Hahn, for\nrespondent.\nSUMMARY OPINION\nGOEKE, Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions of section\n7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the petition was filed.1\n1Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal\n(continued...)- 2 -\nPursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by any\nother court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other case.\nRespondent determined deficiencies in income tax for 2014, 2015, and 2016\nof $8,725, $7,085, and $5,890, respectively, and an accuracy-related penalty under\nsection 6662(a) for each year. Respondent has conceded the accuracy-related\npenalties. He has also conceded that petitioner is entitled to claim two of her three\nchildren as qualifying child dependents for purposes of personal exemptions, the\nchild tax credit, and the earned income credit for 2014, 2015, and 2016.\nThe remaining issues are whether petitioner is entitled to head of household\nfiling status for 2015 and 2016 and a $1,000 education credit for 2014. We find\nthat she properly filed as head of household for 2015 and 2016. However, she has\nnot established that she is entitled to the education credit for 2014.\nBackground\nPetitioner was a medical assistant during 2014, 2015, and 2016. She lived\nwith her three children and their father. She was not married to her children\u2019s\nfather during the years at issue. She paid most of the household expenses for each\nyear at issue but filed as head of household for only 2015 and 2016. She filed as\n1(...continued)\nRevenue Code as amended and in effect at all relevant times, and all Rule\nreferences are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.- 3 -\nsingle for 2014. One of petitioner\u2019s children is disabled. The children\u2019s father did\nnot claim the three children as his dependents for the years at issue, and he did not\nfile as head of household for 2015 and 2016. He struggled with medical debts and\nother personal expenses, and petitioner had a greater adjusted gross income during\nthe years at issue. There was no written support agreement regarding the children.\nPetitioner was a student in 2013 and paid tuition in that year, but there is no\nevidence that she paid tuition in 2014.\nDiscussion\nPursuant to section 2(b), an individual is considered a head of household\nand thereby entitled to the section 63(c) standard deduction for this filing status if\nshe meets certain conditions. These conditions are, in relevant part:\na. she was not married at the close of the taxable year;\nb. she was not a surviving spouse as defined in section 2(a);\nc. she maintained as her home a household whose membership\nincluded, for more than one-half of the taxable year, a qualifying\nchild of the individual as defined in section 152(c); and\nd. She furnished over half of the cost of maintaining the household\nduring the taxable year.\nOn the basis of our factual findings petitioner is entitled to head of\nhousehold filing status for 2015 and 2016. Respondent\u2019s argument that petitioner- 4 -\nhas not met the burden of proof under Rule 142(a) as to her filing status is\nincorrect.\nRegarding the education credit under section 25A(a) at issue for 2014,\npetitioner must establish the payment of tuition in 2014 to qualify for the credit.\nUnfortunately, the records she submitted do not establish that payment.\nAccordingly, she is not entitled to the education credit for 2014.\nTo reflect the foregoing,\nDecision will be entered under\nRule 155.",

Hunt, Assistant\nAttorney General; Ernesto H.\nMolina, Jr., Deputy Director,\nNancy N. Safavi, Trial Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation,\nUnited States Department of\nJustice, Washington, DC.UPON DUE CONSIDERATION of this petition for review of a\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision, it is hereby\nORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the petition for review\nis DENIED.\nPetitioner Zhi Xin An, a native and citizen of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of a January 16,\n2018, decision of the BIA affirming an April 7, 2017, decision\nof an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying his application for\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\nConvention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). In re Zhi Xin An, No.\nA206 058 648 (B.I.A. Jan. 16, 2018), aff\u2019g No. A206 058 648\n(Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 7, 2017). We assume the parties\u2019\nfamiliarity with the underlying facts and procedural history\nin this case.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed\nboth the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions \u201cfor the sake of\ncompleteness.\u201d Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Security, 448\nF.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir. 2006). The applicable standards of\nreview are well established. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B);\nHong Fei Gao v. Sessions, 891 F.3d 67, 76 (2d Cir. 2018).\n\u201cConsidering the totality of the circumstances, and all\nrelevant factors, a trier of fact may base a credibility\n2determination on . . . the consistency between the applicant\u2019s\nor witness\u2019s written and oral statements . . . , the internal\nconsistency of each such statement, the consistency of such\nstatements with other evidence of record . . . , and any\ninaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements, without regard\nto whether an inconsistency, inaccuracy, or falsehood goes to\nthe heart of the applicant\u2019s claim, or any other relevant\nfactor.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). \u201cWe defer . . . to\nan IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality\nof the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-\nfinder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u201d Xiu\nXia Lin v. Mukasey, 534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. 2008); accord\nHong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 76. Substantial evidence supports\nthe agency\u2019s determination that An was not credible.\nAs an initial matter, An only challenges the agency\u2019s\nadverse credibility determination as it pertains to his fear\nof future persecution on account of his activities in the\nUnited States. Accordingly, he has waived any challenge to\nthe agency\u2019s conclusion that he was not credible as to his\nclaim of past persecution. See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales,\n426 F.3d 540, 541 n.1, 545 n.7 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201cIssues not\nsufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and\n3normally will not be addressed on appeal.\u201d (quoting Norton v.\nSam\u2019s Club, 145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir. 1998))).\nThe agency reasonably relied on inconsistencies within\nAn\u2019s statements and between his statements and documentary\nevidence regarding his involvement in the United States with\nthe magazine Beijing Spring, and when police first approached\nhis parents and threatened them. Each of these findings is\nsupported by the record. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii);\nsee also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 165-67. An\u2019s testimony\nbetween the 2015 hearing and the 2017 hearing was inconsistent\nregarding the extent of his political activities in the United\nStates. In 2015, he testified that he was an assistant editor\nof the magazine Beijing Spring. But in 2017, at the hearing\nspecifically to address future persecution based on his\nactivities in the United States, An did not mention his\nposition as editor until asked about it on cross examination.\nThe agency did not err in relying on this omission because it\nwas a significant and specific fact that went to the heart of\nAn\u2019s fear of future persecution. See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d\nat 78\u201379 (weight given to an omission depends, in part, on\nwhether \u201cfacts are ones that a credible petitioner would\nreasonably have been expected to disclose under the relevant\n4circumstances\u201d). The IJ was not compelled to credit An\u2019s\nexplanation that he was nervous and forgot to mention this\nposition. See Ming Zhang v. Holder, 585 F.3d 715, 725 (2d\nCir. 2009) (\u201cWe again reject the notion that a petitioner\u2019s\nclaim that [h]e was nervous and distracted during the credible\nfear interview automatically undermines or negates its\nreliability as a source of h[is] statements.\u201d); Majidi v.\nGonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir. 2005) (\u201cA petitioner must\ndo more than offer a plausible explanation for his\ninconsistent statements to secure relief; he must demonstrate\nthat a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to credit\nhis testimony.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nNor did the agency err in relying on the discrepancy\nbetween An\u2019s testimony and his mother\u2019s letter regarding when\nthe Chinese police approached and threatened his parents. An\ntestified in March 2015 that Chinese authorities had learned\nof his activities in the United States and threatened his\nparents. But his mother\u2019s letter, submitted after the\ninitial hearing, states that she and An\u2019s father learned of\nAn\u2019s activities in the United States when the police\nquestioned and threatened them in September 2015, i.e., after\nthe hearing at which An testified to the threats. The agency\n5did not err in relying on this discrepancy because it created\nan inconsistency in the timeline and the omission was central\nto An\u2019s fear of future persecution. See Hong Fei Gao, 891\nF.3d at 79.\nAdditionally, given the inconsistency with his parents\u2019\nletters, An did not rehabilitate his questionable testimony\nwith reliable corroborating evidence regarding his fear of\nfuture persecution upon return to China. See Biao Yang v.\nGonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2007) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s\nfailure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on\ncredibility, because the absence of corroboration in general\nmakes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has\nalready been called into question.\u201d). Accordingly, given the\ninconsistencies and the lack of reliable corroboration, the\nadverse credibility determination is supported by substantial\nevidence. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167. That\ndetermination is dispositive of asylum, withholding of\nremoval, and CAT relief because all three claims are based on\nthe same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d\n148, 156-57 (2d Cir. 2006). Because this adverse credibility\ndetermination is dispositive, we do not reach the agency\u2019s\nalternative bases for its decision. See INS v. Bagamasbad,\n6429 U.S. 24, 25 (1976) (\u201cAs a general rule courts and agencies\nare not required to make findings on issues the decision of\nwhich is unnecessary to the results they reach.\u201d).\nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\nDENIED. All pending motions and applications are DENIED and\nstays VACATED.\nFOR THE COURT:\nCatherine O\u2019Hagan Wolfe,\nClerk of Court\n7",

Duhart, 752 F. App\u2019x 954 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam)\n(unpublished), this panel reversed the district court\u2019s decision granting Donald\nDuhart\u2019s motion to vacate his conviction for using and carrying a firearm during a\ncrime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)\u2013(2). Id. at 956. The\nSupreme Court vacated our judgment and remanded the case to us for further\nconsideration in light of its decision in United States v. Davis, 588 U.S. ___, 139 S.\nCt. 2319 (2019), which struck down \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause as\nunconstitutionally vague, id. at 2336. See Duhart v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 100\n(2019). On remand, and in light of this Court\u2019s decision in Brown v. United States,\n942 F.3d 1069 (11th Cir. 2019), Mr. Duhart\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) cannot\nstand. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision vacating Mr. Duhart\u2019s\nconviction under \u00a7 924(c) and remand with directions to resentence him on an\nexpedited basis.\nI.\nA federal grand jury indicted Mr. Duhart and his co-conspirators with\nvarious drug, firearm, and robbery offenses. The indictment specifically charged\nMr. Duhart with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count 1); conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five\nkilograms or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)\n2Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 3 of 10\n(Count 2); using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence and in relation\nto a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)\u2013(2) (Count 3);\nconspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and relation to a crime of violence, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o) (Count 6); and being a felon in possession of a\nfirearm or ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (Count 7). With respect\nto Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) charge in Count 3, the indictment specified that (1) the\npredicate \u201ccrime of violence\u201d was conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery as\ncharged in Count 1; and (2) the predicate \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d was conspiracy\nto possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine as charged in\nCount 2.\nMr. Duhart entered an agreement to plead guilty to Counts 1 and 3. Unlike\nthe indictment, which stated that Count 3 was predicated on the offenses charged\nin Counts 1 and 2, his plea agreement indicated that Count 3 was predicated solely\non the \u201ccrime of violence\u201d charged in Count 1, namely conspiracy to commit\nHobbs Act robbery. During Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea colloquy, the District Court\nexplained that the version of Count 3 to which Duhart pled guilty \u201calleges that [he]\nknowingly used and carried a firearm . . . in relation to a crime of violence and\nthat\u2019s a violation of [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a)].\u201d At no point during Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea\ncolloquy did the court otherwise indicate that Count 3 was predicated on a drug\ntrafficking crime.\n3Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 4 of 10\nThe District Court accepted Mr. Duhart\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced him to\n87-months imprisonment on the conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery\nconviction together with a consecutive 60-months imprisonment on the \u00a7 924(c)\nconviction. His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. United\nStates v. Duhart, 379 F. App\u2019x 814, *1 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam)\n(unpublished). Mr. Duhart later filed a motion for post-conviction relief under 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which was unsuccessful in District Court and on appeal. Duhart v.\nUnited States, 556 F. App\u2019x 897, 899\u201390 (11th Cir. 2014) (per curiam)\n(unpublished).\nWith this Court\u2019s authorization, Mr. Duhart filed a second \u00a7 2255 motion.\nIn it, he argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States, 576\nU.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), rendered his \u00a7 924(c) conviction invalid. In\nJohnson, the Supreme Court struck down the residual clause in the Armed Career\nCriminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), as unconstitutionally vague.\n135 S. Ct. at 2563. That clause defined \u201cviolent felonies\u201d as those \u201cinvolv[ing]\nconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18\nU.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Similar to the ACCA, \u00a7 924(c) also contains a residual\nclause, which defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that \u201cby its nature, involves\na substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may\nbe used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Mr.\n4Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 5 of 10\nDuhart argued that Johnson, by holding the ACCA\u2019s residual clause was\nunconstitutionally vague, also invalidated \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause.\nSeparate from \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause is its elements clause, which\ndefines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d\nId. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Mr. Duhart also argued that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act\nrobbery did not qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause\nbecause conspiracy does not require an overt act toward the commission of\nsubstantive Hobbs Act robbery. According to Mr. Duhart, because Johnson\ninvalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause, and because conspiracy to commit Hobbs\nAct robbery was not otherwise a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements\nclause, Count 3 could not stand.\nThe District Court agreed with Mr. Duhart and vacated his \u00a7 924(c)\nconviction. The government appealed, arguing (1) that the District Court was\nwithout jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) Johnson did\nnot invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause. We held the District Court properly\nexercised jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion, but reversed in\nlight of our decision in In re Garrett, 908 F.3d 686 (11th Cir. 2018), which held\nthat Johnson did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause. See Duhart, 752 F.\n5Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 6 of 10\nApp\u2019x at 956 (citing Garrett, 908 F.3d at 689). Mr. Duhart petitioned the Supreme\nCourt for certiorari.\nII.\nSeveral months later the Supreme Court issued its decision in Davis, which\nstruck down \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. 139 S. Ct.\nat 2336. While our court has held that Davis announced a new rule of\nconstitutional law retroactive to cases on collateral review, see In re Hammoud,\n931 F.3d 1032, 1037\u201338 (11th Cir. 2019), we have also recognized two important\nlimitations to Davis\u2019s scope. First, Davis addressed only the constitutionality of\n\u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on crimes of violence, while leaving undisturbed\n\u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on drug trafficking crimes. See In re Navarro, 931\nF.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 924(c) convictions\n\u201cfully supported by [] drug-trafficking crimes\u201d are \u201coutside the scope of Davis\u201d).\nSecond, Davis invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause but left its elements clause\nintact. See Brown, 942 F.3d at 1075.\nOn October 7, 2019, the Supreme Court granted Mr. Duhart\u2019s petition for\ncertiorari, vacated our decision denying his second \u00a7 2255 motion, and remanded\nfor further consideration in light of Davis. Duhart v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 100\n(2019). Though Davis now precludes liability under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause,\nour inquiry does not ordinarily end there. After all, a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)\n6Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 7 of 10\nremains valid if it is supported by a drug trafficking crime or if its predicate \u201ccrime\nof violence\u201d otherwise qualifies under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. See Brown,\n942 F.3d at 1073\u201374. Here, however, the government did not raise any alternative\nbases for Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction in either its opening or reply brief, and\nthus waived any such argument on appeal. See United States v. Ardley, 242 F.3d\n989, 990 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (holding, in a case remanded from the\nSupreme Court, that issues not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned).\nEven if we considered alternative bases for Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction, this\ncourt\u2019s decision in Brown would require that we vacate his sentence because\n(1) the record conclusively establishes that Duhart\u2019s conviction was not predicated\non a drug trafficking crime; and (2) the sole underlying offense does not qualify as\na \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause.\nIII.\nTo prove an offense under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), the government must establish\nthat a defendant used or possessed a firearm in relation to and in furtherance of a\n\u201ccrime of violence\u201d or a \u201cdrug trafficking crime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). A\nconviction under \u00a7 924(c) \u201cdoes not require that a defendant be convicted of, or\neven charged with, the predicate offense.\u201d United States v. Frye, 402 F.3d 1123,\n1127 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam). Our precedent provides that when determining\nwhich predicate offenses underlie a defendant\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction, we may refer\n7Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 8 of 10\nto a defendant\u2019s indictment, plea agreement, plea colloquy, and attendant factual\nproffer. See Navarro, 931 F.3d at 1302 (holding that defendant\u2019s factual proffer\nestablished that his \u00a7 924(c) charge was predicated on a drug trafficking crime,\nthus precluding relief under Davis).\nThis court\u2019s decision in Brown squarely establishes that Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)\nconviction was predicated not on a drug trafficking crime, but on a crime of\nviolence. In Brown, the indictment charged the defendant with conspiracy to\ncommit Hobbs Act robbery, two drug trafficking crimes, and a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\noffense. 942 F.3d at 1070\u201371. The indictment specified that the \u00a7 924(c) charge\nwas predicated on both a crime of violence and drug trafficking crimes. Id. The\ndefendant\u2019s plea agreement, however, identified only a crime of violence\u2014\nconspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery\u2014as the sole predicate for his \u00a7 924(c)\ncharge. During the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy, the court explained that the \u00a7 924(c)\ncharge to which he pled guilty was based only on a crime of violence. Id. at 1071.\nBecause the defendant \u201cpled guilty to a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense predicated only on\nconspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery,\u201d we concluded that his \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\nconviction was not otherwise supported by a drug trafficking crime. Id. at 1074\u2013\n75.\nMr. Duhart\u2019s case is materially indistinguishable from Brown. His\nindictment lists both a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime as predicates\n8Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 9 of 10\nfor his \u00a7 924(c) count, but his plea agreement identifies only a predicate crime of\nviolence. And during Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea colloquy, the court explained that his\n\u00a7 924(c) charge was based on a crime of violence, while making no mention of a\npredicate drug trafficking crime. On these facts, it is plain that Mr. Duhart\u2019s\n\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction was predicated only on a crime of violence. See Brown,\n942 F.3d at 1074\u201375.\nIV.\nThat brings us to whether the offense underlying Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)\nconviction otherwise qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements\nclause. As an initial matter, Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea agreement and colloquy make clear\nthat the designated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d underlying his \u00a7 924(c) conviction was\nconspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery rather than substantive Hobbs Act\nrobbery. This distinction is important, because this court\u2019s precedent provides that\nsubstantive Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s\nelements clause. In re Fleur, 824 F.3d 1337, 1340\u201341 (11th Cir. 2016) (per\ncuriam). In contrast, this Court in Brown held that conspiracy to commit Hobbs\nAct robbery does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under\n\u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. 942 F.3d at 1075\u201376. Based on our precedent,\nthen, the sole predicate offense for Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction\u2014conspiracy to\ncommit Hobbs Act robbery\u2014cannot support his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s\n9Case: 17-11476 Date Filed: 02/07/2020 Page: 10 of 10\nelements clause. And because Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction cannot otherwise rely\non \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s now-defunct residual clause, his conviction for Count 3 is invalid\nand must be vacated.\nWe thus AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion\nand REMAND for resentencing. We are mindful that Mr. Duhart is now serving a\nsentence for a crime that is no longer valid. The district court is therefore directed\nto resentence him on an expedited basis.\n10",

See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\n2_________________________________\nBefore MATHESON, KELLY, and PHILLIPS, Circuit Judges.\n_________________________________\nRosemary Ann Lynn, appearing pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s\norders dismissing her complaint against Defendant Andrew George Brown, III\n(No. 19-5062) and a second complaint against Mr. Brown and a host of other\ndefendants (No. 19-5063) for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.1 She has also\nmoved for expedited consideration of her appeal in No. 19-5063. Exercising\nappellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm both of the district court\u2019s\norders and deny her motion to expedite as moot.\nBACKGROUND\nMs. Lynn filed the complaints underlying her appeals in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Northern District of Oklahoma. Though her allegations in these related\ncases are difficult to follow in many respects, together they appear to allege that\nMs. Lynn provided services to Mr. Brown\u2019s elderly sister, Audrey Louise Brown\n(Audrey), from 2008 through 2017. She claims that in September 2017, Audrey\nexecuted documents that appointed Ms. Lynn as Audrey\u2019s \u201cguardian, caregiver,\ntrustee, beneficiary, devisee, legatee, and personal representative of the Audrey\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral\nestoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with\nFed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.\n1 We address these appeals in a single order because the facts alleged by\nMs. Lynn in the two complaints overlap, as do some of the relevant legal standards.\n3Louise Brown Estate,\u201d No. 19-5063 R. at 14, and gave her full control over Audrey\u2019s\nconsiderable estate.2 Mr. Brown then apparently instituted proceedings in Tulsa\nCounty Probate Court that resulted in Audrey being declared incompetent and\nremoved from Ms. Lynn\u2019s care. Ms. Lynn complains that the probate court also\nremoved her as Audrey\u2019s guardian and appointed a guardian ad litem and other\ntemporary and then permanent guardians for Audrey, as well as a conservator to\nadminister Audrey\u2019s property and assets. It also appears from Ms. Lynn\u2019s allegations\nthat the probate court invalidated the documents that purportedly gave her control\nover Audrey and her assets and made her the beneficiary of Audrey\u2019s estate. Both\ncomplaints also include other rambling and conclusory allegations about actions\ntaken by different individuals and entities with respect to Audrey and/or her estate.\nAgainst this backdrop, Ms. Lynn\u2019s first complaint asserts claims for\ndefamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Mr. Brown, based\non allegedly false statements he made about her in legal documents filed in the\nguardianship proceedings. We refer to this action hereinafter as the \u201cDefamation\nComplaint.\u201d Ms. Lynn did not assert a basis for federal jurisdiction in this complaint,\nbut specifically alleged in it that both she and Mr. Brown were citizens of Oklahoma.\nAfter sua sponte considering the issue, the district court dismissed the complaint\nwithout prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, holding there was no basis\nfor it to exercise diversity jurisdiction over her state law claims and no federal\n2 Ms. Lynn asserts in her appellate brief that the estate contains \u201chundreds of\nmillions of dollars.\u201d No. 19-5063 Aplt. Br. at 6.\n4question presented on the face of the complaint. Ms. Lynn timely appealed the\ndistrict court\u2019s order of dismissal in Appeal No. 19-5062.\nIn her second complaint, Ms. Lynn sued Mr. Brown, the probate judge who\npresided in the guardianship proceedings, the court-appointed guardians and\nconservator, numerous attorneys, other named individuals and financial institutions,\nand 200 unknown individuals and entities. Her complaint references the Racketeer\nInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, and we\nrefer to this complaint hereinafter as the \u201cRICO Complaint.\u201d Ms. Lynn asserted in\nthis complaint that the court had both diversity and federal-question jurisdiction.\nAgain acting sua sponte, the district court dismissed it without prejudice for lack of\nsubject-matter jurisdiction. In so doing, the district court held diversity jurisdiction\nwas lacking because there was not complete diversity among the parties, most of\nwhom Ms. Lynn alleged were citizens of Oklahoma. It also found there was no basis\non which to exercise federal-question jurisdiction because Ms. Lynn had fallen far\nshort of stating a RICO claim. Ms. Lynn timely appealed the district court\u2019s order of\ndismissal, and that appeal is before us as No. 19-5063.\nDISCUSSION\nWe review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaints for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction de novo. Blue Valley Hosp., Inc. v. Azar, 919 F.3d 1278,\n1283 (10th Cir. 2019). Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and\nMs. Lynn, as the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, had the burden of\nestablishing the court\u2019s jurisdiction over each of her complaints. See Becker v. Ute\n5Indian Tribe of Uintah & Ouray Reservation, 770 F.3d 944, 946-47 (10th Cir. 2014).\nAs relevant here, this required her to establish either diversity jurisdiction as\nprovided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 or federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1331. See Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. Jackson, 139 S. Ct. 1743, 1746 (2019)\n(describing federal courts\u2019 limited jurisdiction). In determining whether Ms. Lynn\nmet this burden, we take as true all \u201cwell-pled factual allegations,\u201d Blue Valley\nHosp., 919 F.3d at 1283, that is, all allegations that are \u201cplausible, non-conclusory,\nand non-speculative,\u201d Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion Fine Arts, Inc., 514 F.3d 1063,\n1070 (10th Cir. 2008) (defining \u201cwell-pled\u201d allegations). Because Ms. Lynn is acting\npro se in these actions, we also construe her filings liberally, but we do not act as her\nadvocate. Yang v. Archuleta, 525 F.3d 925, 927 n.1 (10th Cir. 2008).\nA. Defamation Complaint\nMost of Ms. Lynn\u2019s arguments in her brief to this court are irrelevant to the\njurisdictional question decided by the district court.3 To the extent Ms. Lynn\naddresses the court\u2019s jurisdiction in her brief, she merely declares that\nfederal-question jurisdiction exists because her admittedly state-law defamation\nclaim \u201cechoed in federal law under the First Amendment.\u201d No. 19-5062 Aplt. Br.\nat 13. She cites no authority supporting this novel proposition and there is none. Her\nsuggestion that the district court had some ulterior motive in sua sponte dismissing\n3 Ms. Lynn devotes the majority of her brief to arguing the merits of her\ndefamation claim, asserting that she properly pled this state-law claim, and accusing\nMr. Brown and others of various misdeeds.\n6her complaint is also unsupported and ignores that \u201c[f]ederal courts have an\nindependent obligation to determine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists, even\nin the absence of a challenge from any party.\u201d4 1mage Software, Inc. v. Reynolds &\nReynolds Co., 459 F.3d 1044, 1048 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \u201c[T]hus a court may sua sponte raise the question of whether there is\nsubject matter jurisdiction at any stage in the litigation,\u201d id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted), and \u201cmust dismiss the cause at any stage of the proceedings in which it\nbecomes apparent that jurisdiction is lacking,\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States,\n790 F.3d 1143, 1151 (10th Cir. 2015) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We have reviewed Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaint in this action and agree that her\nallegations fail to establish any basis for federal jurisdiction. The district court\ntherefore properly dismissed her complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\nB. RICO Complaint\nThe question presented in this appeal is whether the district court properly held\nthat Ms. Lynn failed to allege a claim arising under federal law despite referencing\nthe RICO Act in her complaint.5 While claims asserted under the RICO Act\n4 Ms. Lynn\u2019s references to the district court judge as a \u201cRespondent\u201d in the\ncaption of her briefs in both appeals and in her argument are also mistaken. The district\ncourt judge is not a party to either appeal or the underlying actions. We also find no\nsupport in the record for Ms. Lynn\u2019s suggestion that the district court\u2019s dismissal of her\ncomplaints was motivated by bias.\n5 Ms. Lynn\u2019s arguments regarding personal jurisdiction, service of process,\nvenue, and other unrelated topics in her appellate brief are irrelevant to deciding this\nquestion.\n7ordinarily qualify for federal-question jurisdiction, \u201cjurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 exists\nonly where there is a colorable claim arising under federal law.\u201d McKenzie v. U.S.\nCitizenship & Immigration Servs., Dist. Dir., 761 F.3d 1149, 1156 (10th Cir. 2014)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A] court may dismiss for lack of subject-matter\njurisdiction when the [purported federal] claim is so insubstantial, implausible,\nforeclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise completely devoid of merit\nas not to involve a federal controversy.\u201d Id. at 1156-57 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The district court held that this was the case here, and we agree.\nA civil RICO claim may be brought by \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or\nproperty by reason of a violation of [18 U.S.C.] section 1962.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).\nMs. Lynn alleges in her complaint that the defendants violated the entire RICO\nstatute, but as best we can determine she is attempting to allege that each of them\nviolated \u00a7 1962(c).6 To state a civil RICO claim for violation of \u00a7 1962(c), Ms. Lynn\nwas required to \u201cplausibly allege that the defendants each (1) conducted the affairs\n(2) of an enterprise (3) through a pattern (4) of racketeering activity.\u201d Safe Streets\n6 This conclusion is consistent with Ms. Lynn\u2019s argument in support of her\nmotion for a temporary restraining order in the district court, in which she asserted\nthat the defendants had violated \u00a7 1962(c). In her appellate brief, however, Ms. Lynn\ndeclares that her complaint also alleges that her business or property were injured as\na result of violations of \u00a7 1962(a) (prohibiting investment of income derived from a\npattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise engaged in interstate or foreign\ncommerce), \u00a7 1962(b) (prohibiting acquisition or maintenance through a pattern of\nracketeering activity of an interest in or control of an enterprise engaged in\ninterstate or foreign commerce), and \u00a7 1962(d) (prohibiting conspiracy to violate\n\u00a7 1962(a)-(c)). But Ms. Lynn does not point to any allegations supporting this\nassertion and we found none in our careful review of her complaint.\n8All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 882 (10th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaint does not state a colorable RICO claim against any of\nthe defendants for a variety of reasons, only some of which we address here.\nFirst, Ms. Lynn\u2019s attempt to allege a RICO enterprise is completely devoid of\nmerit. As the district court noted, Ms. Lynn\u2019s rambling complaint alleges that\ndifferent defendants mistreated Audrey and/or her estate in different ways. Ms. Lynn\ntries to cast this alleged mistreatment in RICO terms by alleging that the named and\nunnamed defendants \u201cwere working as a single entity and enterprise to commit\nextrinsic fraud, intrinsic fraud, extortion, kidnapping, undue influence, perjury,\nforgery, mail, and wire fraud through communications.\u201d No. 19-5063 R. at 12. But\nthis apparent attempt to allege an \u201cassociation-in-fact\u201d RICO enterprise7 fails not\nonly because it is conclusory, see Hall v. Bellmon, 935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.\n1991) (holding that a pro se litigant\u2019s \u201cconclusory allegations without supporting\nfactual averments are insufficient to state a claim on which relief can be based\u201d), but\nalso because Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaint does not connect the defendants\u2019 different\nconduct to the alleged enterprise or provide a plausible basis for finding that the\ndefendants were and are functioning as a continuing unit, see Boyle v. United States,\n556 U.S. 938, 944-45 (2009) (defining an association-in-fact RICO enterprise as a\n7 RICO defines an \u201centerprise\u201d as \u201cany individual, partnership, corporation,\nassociation, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact\nalthough not a legal entity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(4). Because the collection of defendants\nnamed by Ms. Lynn is not a legal entity, the only potential RICO enterprise that might be\napplicable here is the last portion of this definition, regarding association-in-fact\nenterprises.\n9\u201cgroup of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course\nof conduct,\u201d which is demonstrated \u201cby evidence of an ongoing organization, formal\nor informal, and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit\u201d\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\nMs. Lynn\u2019s complaint similarly falls far short of plausibly alleging\n\u201cracketeering activity\u201d by the defendants. Only some of the wrongful conduct listed\nby Ms. Lynn\u2014namely mail and wire fraud, extortion, and kidnapping\u2014qualify as\n\u201cracketeering activity\u201d that might support a RICO claim. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1);\nsee also Beck v. Prupis, 529 U.S. 494, 497 n.2 (2000) (\u201cSection 1961(1) contains an\nexhaustive list of acts of \u2018racketeering,\u2019 commonly referred to as \u2018predicate acts.\u2019\u201d).\nAnd Ms. Lynn was required to do more than just list these alleged predicate acts to\nstate a RICO claim\u2014she needed to plead the elements of each predicate act, and to\ndo so with particularity with respect to those sounding in fraud. See Robbins v.\nWilkie, 300 F.3d 1208, 1211 (10th Cir. 2002); Farlow v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &\nCo., 956 F.2d 982, 989 (10th Cir. 1992). Ms. Lynn did not come close to doing so.8\nFor example, to plead the predicate acts of mail and wire fraud, Ms. Lynn\nneeded to \u201cplausibly allege the existence of a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain\n8 In her appellate brief, Ms. Lynn complains of additional alleged\nwrong-doing by defendants that occurred after the district court dismissed her\ncomplaint. We do not consider these additional allegations in assessing whether she\nstated a colorable RICO claim because these new allegations were not included in her\ncomplaint or otherwise presented to the district court. See Regan-Touhy v. Walgreen\nCo., 526 F.3d 641, 648 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201cWe generally limit our review on appeal to the\nrecord that was before the district court when it made its decision\u201d).\n10money or property by false pretenses, representations or promises, and that [the\nalleged enterprise] communicated, or caused communications to occur, through the\nU.S. mail or interstate wires to execute that fraudulent scheme.\u201d George v. Urban\nSettlement Servs., 833 F.3d 1242, 1254 (10th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). \u201cAnd because Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) requires a plaintiff to plead mail and\nwire fraud with particularity,\u201d she was further required to plead \u201cthe time, place and\ncontents of the false representation[s], the identity of the party making the false\nstatements and the consequences thereof\u201d as relevant to the alleged mail and wire\nfraud. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaint is devoid of\nallegations meeting this standard. In addition, to the extent Ms. Lynn pled any of the\nelements of kidnapping or extortion in her complaint, she offered only \u201clabels and\nconclusions\u201d and \u201cnaked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.\u201d Ashcroft\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\nSuch allegations are insufficient even under the more relaxed pleading standard of\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8. See id.\nAccordingly, we agree with the district court that Ms. Lynn failed to state a\ncolorable RICO claim, and that the district court therefore lacked federal-question\njurisdiction over her purported RICO Complaint. As it is also indisputable that\ndiversity jurisdiction was lacking, the district court properly dismissed this complaint\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction.9\n9 Contrary to Ms. Lynn\u2019s argument here, the district court was not required to\nallow her discovery to cure these deficiencies.\n11CONCLUSION\nWe affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Ms. Lynn\u2019s complaints.

    "text": "In The\nCourt of Appeals\nSixth Appellate District of Texas at Texarkana\nNo. 06-19-00181-CR\nIRISH SHUNTAY WARE, Appellant\nV.\nTHE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee\nOn Appeal from the 123rd District Court\nPanola County, Texas\nTrial Court No. 2017-C-0021\nBefore Morriss, C.J., Burgess and Stevens, JJ.\nMemorandum Opinion by Justice StevensMEMORANDUM OPINION\nIrish Shuntay Ware pled guilty to robbery and was placed on deferred adjudication\ncommunity supervision for ten years under her plea bargain agreement with the State. The terms\nand conditions of Ware\u2019s community supervision required her to refrain from committing another\ncriminal offense or consuming alcoholic beverages, among other things. The State moved to\nadjudicate Ware\u2019s guilt on several grounds, including that she committed the offense of driving\nwhile intoxicated (DWI) on June 1, 2019. After Ware pled true to this allegation and the trial court\nheard evidence on each ground in the State\u2019s motion, the trial court adjudicated Ware\u2019s guilt and\nsentenced her to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment.\nOn appeal, Ware claims she did not enter a plea of true to any allegation in the State\u2019s\nmotion, but argues that her plea of true to one ground was involuntary because (1) she did not have\nfair notice of the basis of the revocation, (2) the motion to adjudicate lacked sufficient specificity,\nand (3) she was not made aware of the consequences of her plea. Ware also argues that the\nevidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that she violated the terms and\nconditions of her deferred adjudication community supervision and that her counsel rendered\nineffective assistance in failing to object to the lack of specificity in the State\u2019s adjudication\nmotion.\nWe find that Ware\u2019s claim that she did not plead true to any allegation in the State\u2019s motion\nis meritless, that Ware\u2019s arguments that her plea was involuntary are unpreserved, and that\nsufficient evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding of true to at least one allegation in the State\u2019s\n2motion to adjudicate guilt. We also find that Ware cannot show that her counsel rendered\nineffective assistance. As a result, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\nI. Ware\u2019s Claim that She Pled Not True to all Allegations Is Meritless\nFirst, Ware claims that she pled not true to all allegations in the State\u2019s motion to adjudicate\nguilt. We find this claim is meritless since the record establishes otherwise.\nAfter twelve of the allegations in the State\u2019s indictment were read, the trial court asked for\nWare\u2019s plea, and Ware stated, \u201cSome of them are not true.\u201d During Ware\u2019s clarification of which\nallegations were true, the record shows the following:\nTHE COURT: There are two DWIs you\u2019ve been arrested for since you\nwere released from state jail?\n. . . .\n. . . To the allegations that you -- regarding the DWIs, you can enter a plea\nof \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201cnot true.\u201d\nTHE DEFENDANT: It\u2019s true. One of them is true.\nTHE COURT: Okay, okay.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma\u2019am.\nTHE COURT: One of those -- which one is true?\nTHE DEFENDANT: I believe it\u2019s the June one.\nTHE COURT: The June one is true.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I think so.\n. . . .\n[BY THE STATE]: And she -- and I just want to be sure the record is\naccurate here. She is pleading \u201ctrue\u201d to our Allegation No. 3 that she did on or\n3about the 1st day of June intentionally and knowingly operate a motor vehicle under\nthe influence?\nTHE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: True.\n[BY THE STATE]: Very good, Your Honor. Thank you.\nThe reporter\u2019s record shows that Ware pled true to the State\u2019s allegation that Ware\ncommitted the offense of driving while intoxicated on June 1, 2019, in Panola County, Texas. As\na result, Ware\u2019s claim that she pled not true to every allegation in the State\u2019s motion is meritless.\nWe overrule Ware\u2019s first point of error.\nII. Ware\u2019s Arguments that Her Plea Was Involuntary Are Unpreserved\nIn her second point of error, Ware argues that her plea of true was involuntary because\n(1) she lacked fair notice of the basis of the revocation, (2) the pleadings lacked sufficient\nspecificity to describe what conduct was committed to violate a term or condition of community\nsupervision, and (3) she was not made aware of the consequences of her plea. We find Ware\u2019s\npoint of error unpreserved.\nFirst, Ware argues that she did not have fair notice of the State\u2019s third allegation, which\nalleged that she \u201con or about the 1st day of June, 2019, in Panola County, Texas, did then and\nthere intentionally operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.\u201d She also argues that\n\u201coperating under the influence\u201d constituted an insufficient allegation since the motion failed to\nstate that Ware was intoxicated and did not allege all essential elements of DWI.\n\u201cAs long as the motion [to revoke or adjudicate guilt] provides adequate notice of the\ncharges alleged, fundamental notions of fairness are satisfied, despite flaws in the motion.\u201d\n4Marcum v. State, 983 S.W.2d 762, 767 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [14th Dist.] 1998, pet. ref\u2019d) (citing\nLabelle v. State, 720 S.W.2d 101, 108\u201309 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)). Nonjurisdictional \u201c[e]rrors in\na motion to revoke probation must be pointed out to the trial court in a timely motion to quash.\u201d\nId. (citing Rodriguez v. State, 951 S.W.2d 199, 204 (Tex. App.\u2014Corpus Christi 1997, no pet.);\nLongoria v. State, 624 S.W.2d 582, 584 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1981)). \u201cIn the absence of\nsuch motion, error, if any, is waived.\u201d Id. (citing Gordon v. State, 575 S.W.2d 529, 531 (Tex.\nCrim. App. [Panel Op.] 1978)). To preserve a complaint for our review, a party must first present\nto the trial court a timely request, objection, or motion stating the specific grounds for the desired\nruling if not apparent from the context. TEX. R. APP. P. 33.1(a)(1).\nBecause Ware failed to file a motion to quash, her complaints about fair notice, specificity,\nand correctness of the State\u2019s motion to adjudicate guilt are unpreserved.\nWare complains generally that she was unaware of the consequences of her plea. Article\n26.13 requires a trial court to give certain admonishments to a defendant before accepting a plea\nof guilty or nolo contendere. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 26.13 (Supp.). That said, as\nWare notes, this Article does not apply to adjudication proceedings. See Gutierrez v. State, 108\nS.W.3d 304, 309 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). Even so, Ware argues that the trial court abused its\ndiscretion in finding her plea of true voluntary because there was no discussion concerning the\npossible outcome of a plea.\nBefore accepting Ware\u2019s plea of guilt on the underlying offense of robbery, the trial court\nentered the required Article 26.13 written admonishments, including the applicable range of\npunishment. The order adjudicating her guilt warned her that she would remain on community\n5supervision \u201cso long as [she] abide[d] by and [did] not violate the terms and conditions of\ncommunity supervision.\u201d In signing the terms and conditions of her community supervision, Ware\nagreed that she understood them and that the trial court could \u201crevoke or adjudicate [her]\n[c]ommunity [s]upervision upon a showing by the State that [she] ha[d] violated one or more of\nthe conditions.\u201d Ware was represented by appointed counsel, and the trial court made clear that it\nwas seeking her plea of true or not true on the offense of DWI for the purpose of ruling on the\nState\u2019s motion to adjudicate guilt.\nIn any case, we have held that Rule 33.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure applies\nto a claim that a plea of true in a revocation or adjudication proceeding was involuntary. Lively v.\nState, 338 S.W.3d 140, 143 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2011, no pet.). As a result, \u201cchallenges to the\nvoluntariness of a plea [of true] must be raised before the trial court to preserve the complaint for\nreview on appeal.\u201d Id. (citing Sims v. State, 326 S.W.3d 707, 713 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2010,\npet. struck) (citing Mendez v. State, 138 S.W.3d 334, 339, 350 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)). Here, as\nin Lively, no complaint was made to the trial court before adjudication that the plea was involuntary\nand no motion for new trial raised this issue. Id. As a result, Ware has failed to preserve her\ncomplaint that her plea of true was involuntary. See id.\nWe overrule Ware\u2019s second point of error.\nIII. Sufficient Evidence Supports the Trial Court\u2019s Finding of True\nNext, Ware challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding\nof true. \u201cWe will review the trial court\u2019s decision to revoke community supervision for an abuse\nof discretion.\u201d Id. (citing Rickels v. State, 202 S.W.3d 759, 763 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006); In re\n6T.R.S., 115 S.W.3d 318, 320 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2003, no pet.)); see Garrett v. State, 619\nS.W.2d 172, 174 (Tex. Crim. App. 1981). To revoke community supervision and proceed with\nadjudication of guilt, the State must prove every element of at least one ground for revocation by\na preponderance of the evidence. See Lively, 338 S.W.3d at 143 (\u201cIf a single ground for revocation\nis supported by a preponderance of the evidence and is otherwise valid, then an abuse of discretion\nis not shown.\u201d); Cobb v. State, 851 S.W.2d 871, 873 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993).\n\u201cIn a community supervision revocation hearing, the trial court is the sole trier of fact and\ndetermines the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.\u201d Lively, 338\nS.W.3d at 146 (citing Cherry v. State, 215 S.W.3d 917, 919 (Tex. App.\u2014Fort Worth 2007, pet.\nref\u2019d)); see T.R.S., 115 S.W.3d at 321. A trial court\u2019s decision to revoke community supervision\nis examined \u201cin the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling.\u201d Id. (citing Cardona v. State,\n665 S.W.2d 492, 493 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984)). With exception of failure-to-pay allegations made\nagainst indigent defendants who are unable to pay community supervision fines and fees, a plea of\ntrue standing alone is sufficient to support revocation of community supervision. See Cole v. State,\n578 S.W.2d 127, 128 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1979).\nAfter hearing testimony on the State\u2019s motion, the trial court asked Ware, \u201cAll right,\nma\u2019am. You have admitted on June 1st of 2019, you\u2019ve pled \u2018true\u2019 to intentionally operating a\nmotor vehicle under the influence. Right, ma\u2019am?\u201d After Ware responded again, \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d\nthe trial court said, \u201cI\u2019m going to adjudicate you guilty and convict you of this second-degree\nfelony offense of robbery.\u201d We find that Ware\u2019s plea was sufficient to support the community\nsupervision revocation.\n7The State also had alleged (1) in Allegation 2 that Ware committed DWI on March 15,\n2019, and (2) in Allegation 8 that she failed to report to her community supervision officer in April\nand May. Ware\u2019s community supervision officer testified that Ware failed to report during the\nmonths of April and May, as alleged in the State\u2019s motion. Although Ware offered her excuses\nfor failure to report in person, the trial court, as the fact-finder, was free to dismiss them. Also,\nBrandon Norman, a Texas highway patrolman, testified that he pulled Ware over on March 15,\n2019, and determined that she was driving under the influence of \u201c[s]ome kind of drug.\u201d Norman\ntestified that he obtained a search warrant for her blood but that the results were still pending. We,\ntherefore, find that the evidence was also sufficient to support Allegations 2 and 8.\nProof by a preponderance of the evidence on any one of the alleged violations is sufficient\nto support a trial court\u2019s decision to revoke community supervision. Moore v. State, 605 S.W.2d\n924, 926 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1980). Because we have concluded that the evidence was\nsufficient to support revocation on at least one ground, we need not address the remaining grounds\nfor revocation. See id.; Lively, 338 S.W.3d at 143. We overrule Ware\u2019s third point of error.\nIV. Ware Cannot Show that Her Counsel Rendered Ineffective Assistance\nLast, Ware argues that her counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to\nthe State\u2019s two allegations that she intentionally operated a motor vehicle while intoxicated on\nJune 1 and March 15, 2019, for lack of specificity. We find that Ware cannot show that her counsel\nrendered ineffective assistance.\nAs many cases have noted, the right to counsel does not mean the right to errorless counsel.\nRobertson v. State, 187 S.W.3d 475, 483 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). \u201cIn order to prevail on a claim\n8of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant must satisfy the two-prong test set forth in\nStrickland v. Washington.\u201d Lampkin v. State, 470 S.W.3d 876, 896 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2015,\npet. ref\u2019d) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687\u201388 (1984); Ex parte Imoudu, 284\nS.W.3d 866, 869 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (orig. proceeding)). \u201cThe first prong requires a showing\nthat counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id. at 896\u201397\n(citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688). \u201cThis requirement can be difficult to meet since there is \u2018a\nstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance.\u2019\u201d Id. at 897 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).\n\u201cWhen a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on direct\nappeal, the record \u2018is in almost all cases inadequate to show that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an\nobjectively reasonable standard of performance.\u2019\u201d Parmer v. State, 545 S.W.3d 724, 727\u201328 (Tex.\nApp.\u2014Texarkana 2018, no pet.) (quoting Andrews v. State, 159 S.W.3d 98, 102 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2005)). Moreover, where the reviewing court \u201ccan conceive potential reasonable trial strategies\nthat counsel could have been pursuing,\u201d the court \u201csimply cannot conclude that counsel has\nperformed deficiently.\u201d Andrews v. State, 159 S.W.3d 98, 103 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). \u201c[W]hen\na party raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim for the first time on direct appeal, the\ndefendant must show that \u2018under prevailing professional norms,\u2019 Strickland v. Washington, 466\nU.S. 668, 688 (1984), no competent attorney would do what trial counsel did or no competent\nattorney would fail to do what trial counsel failed to do.\u201d Parmer, 545 S.W.3d at 728 (citing\nAndrews, 159 S.W.3d at 102).\n9The appellant has the burden to prove ineffective assistance of counsel by a preponderance\nof the evidence. Thompson v. State, 9 S.W.3d 808, 813 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). Allegations of\nineffectiveness \u201cmust \u2018be firmly founded in the record.\u2019\u201d Bone v. State, 77 S.W.3d 828, 833 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2002) (quoting Thompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813). The Strickland test \u201cof necessity requires\na case-by-case examination of the evidence.\u201d Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 382 (2000)\n(quoting Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 308 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment)). \u201cA\nfailure to make a showing under either prong defeats a claim of ineffective assistance.\u201d Parmer,\n545 S.W.3d at 728 (citing Rylander v. State, 101 S.W.3d 107, 110\u201311 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003)).\nWare argues that her counsel should have objected to the DWI allegations because they\ndid not allege a crime. In other words, she argues, while the State\u2019s allegation said Ware was\ndriving under the influence, it did not allege that she was intoxicated. The record is silent on why\ncounsel failed to object or move to quash the motion to adjudicate. Because we determine (1) that\nit was reasonable for counsel to believe the action was unnecessary since he could reasonably\nbelieve Ware had fair notice of the DWI allegations and (2) that the adjudication allegations were\nnot required to allege a crime with the specificity required of an indictment, we find that Ware\ncannot meet her burden under the first prong of Strickland.\n\u201cTexas courts have traditionally recognized that an application to revoke [or adjudicate\nguilt] is held to a less rigorous standard than an indictment or information.\u201d Pierce v. State, 113\nS.W.3d 431, 436 (Tex. App.\u2014Texarkana 2003, pet. ref\u2019d). \u201cAn application to revoke [community\nsupervision or adjudicate guilt] need not meet the specificity requirements of an indictment or\ninformation.\u201d Id. (citing Chacon v. State, 558 S.W.2d 874, 876 (Tex. Crim. App. 1977); Tamez v.\n10State, 534 S.W.2d 686, 689 (Tex. Crim. App. 1976)). But \u201c[a] person on community supervision\nis entitled to a written application to revoke [or adjudicate guilt] that fully informs him or her of\nthe term of [community supervision] he or she is alleged to have breached.\u201d Id. \u201cIt is sufficient\nthat the State allege a violation of the law and give the probationer fair notice.\u201d Id. (citing Chacon,\n558 S.W.2d at 876).\nHere, the State alleged that Ware violated the term and condition of her community\nsupervision requiring her to refrain from committing an \u201coffense against the law of this State\u201d and\nthat she, \u201con or about the 1st day of June, 2019, in Panola County, Texas, did then and there\nintentionally operate a motor vehicle while under the influence.\u201d \u201cWhere, as here, the State\nalleges a violation of the condition that a probationer refrain from committing an offense against\nthe law, the State need not use the same precise terms as necessary in an indictment allegation.\u201d\nId. (citing Bradley v. State, 608 S.W.2d 652, 655 (Tex. Crim. App. 1980)). Because counsel could\nhave reasonably believed that the State provided Ware with fair notice of the basis for adjudication\nof her guilt, we can fathom why counsel chose to forgo a motion to quash the allegation. See id.;\nMoore v. State, 11 S.W.3d 495, 499 (Tex. App.\u2014Houston [1st Dist.] 2000, no pet.) (\u201cAll that is\nrequired is that the motion to revoke should fully and clearly set forth the basis on which the State\nseeks revocation so that a defendant and his counsel have notice.\u201d). Counsel could have chosen\nnot to object to a lack of specificity because he found it clear to Ware, as shown by the reporter\u2019s\nrecord, that the offense allegedly committed was DWI. On this record, which is silent on counsel\u2019s\nreasoning, we find that Ware has failed to meet the first Strickland prong.\n11Ware also has not made a showing on the prejudice prong. \u201cThe second Strickland prong,\nsometimes referred to as \u2018the prejudice prong,\u2019 requires a showing that, but for counsel\u2019s\nunprofessional error, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have\nbeen different.\u201d Lampkin, 470 S.W.3d at 897 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). \u201cA reasonable\nprobability\u201d is defined as \u201ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\nWare argues that the State would not have been able to rely on the DWI allegations had\ncounsel objected to them. We disagree. Since Ware has not shown that the State\u2019s motion to\nadjudicate failed to meet the fair-notice standard, she has not shown that there was a reasonable\nprobability that the State\u2019s motion to adjudicate guilt would be quashed. Instead, an objection\nwould have likely produced the result of a more detailed amended adjudication motion. As a\nresult, we find Ware cannot meet the second Strickland prong.\nWe overrule Ware\u2019s last point of error.\nV. Conclusion\nWe affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\nScott E.

Wolpert\nClerk of Court\nJUSTIN MOHN,\nPlaintiff - Appellant,\nv. No. 19-1207\n(D.C. No. 1:18-CV-00812-MSK-KMT)\nPROGRESSIVE INSURANCE, (D. Colo.)\nDefendant - Appellee.\n_________________________________\nORDER AND JUDGMENT*\n_________________________________\nBefore LUCERO, BALDOCK, and MORITZ, Circuit Judges.\n_________________________________\nJustin Mohn, appearing pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of\nsummary judgment to his former employer, Progressive Insurance, on his claims of\nsex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we\naffirm.\n* After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined\nunanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of\nthis appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral\nestoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with\nFed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.I. Background\nProgressive Insurance hired Mohn as a customer service representative in\nOctober 2016. New hires such as Mohn participate in Progressive\u2019s customer service\nacademy program. As part of the academy, Progressive assigns each employee a\ncoach who provides job-specific training. When the coach and a program manager\nconclude that a trainee meets certain job-related metrics, the trainee graduates from\nthe academy. Trainees typically graduate after participating in the academy for 10 to\n12 weeks. Mohn graduated in 13 weeks, finishing in March 2017.\nIn the summer of 2017, Mohn sought permission to apply for other positions\nwith Progressive despite the company\u2019s policy that customer service representatives\nwork with the company for a least a year before applying to switch positions. One of\nMohn\u2019s supervisors declined his request to apply for a position with Progressive\u2019s\ninformation technology service desk because Mohn\u2019s description of his experience\ndid not \u201cmatch what [was] minimally required\u201d for the job. R. Vol. 2 at 316.\nMohn did apply for a senior copywriter position in July 2017. The \u201cminimum\nrequirements\u201d for this position included possessing either a bachelor\u2019s degree in a\nwriting-related field such as journalism or \u201c8 years\u2019 creative writing experience and\nexperience as a copywriter.\u201d Id. at 331. Mohn admits that he did not meet these\nminimum requirements. Progressive did not transfer him to this position.\nMohn also applied for a legal assistant position in August 2017 despite lacking\nany training in the field or prior experience as a legal assistant. Progressive did not\ntransfer him into this position either.\n2On August 5, 2017, Mohn kicked open the doors to Progressive\u2019s facilities.\nWhile Mohn characterized the act as \u201copen[ing] the door with [his] foot,\u201d \u201cbecause\n[he] used to play soccer,\u201d id. at 285, he does not dispute that the act occurred.\nProgressive placed him on administrative leave on August 17 and fired him on\nAugust 24, 2017. The company stated that it fired Mohn due to \u201chis refusal to\ncomply with Progressive\u2019s code of conduct which includes, but is not limited to,\nMr. Mohn kicking open our facility doors.\u201d Id. at 153.\nMohn then filed this suit, alleging Progressive engaged in sex discrimination\nby delaying his graduation from the academy, refusing to promote him, and\nterminating him. Prior to the discovery cutoff, Mohn filed a motion for summary\njudgment in January 2019. In his motion, he complained that Progressive had not\nadequately responded to all his discovery requests and asked that the court compel\nadditional discovery. But he nonetheless \u201ccontend[ed] all the necessary factual\nissues [were] settled or so one-sided they need not be tried, for there [were] no\nimportant facts still in dispute.\u201d Id. at 64.1\nAfter conducting additional discovery, Progressive filed a cross-motion for\nsummary judgment in April 2019. Mohn\u2019s response to Progressive\u2019s motion made\nequivocal remarks regarding the need for additional discovery. For example, at one\npoint he noted that \u201cthere are no factual issues remaining to be tried . . . and there are\n1 Progressive \u201cinterpret[ed] [Mohn\u2019s] motion as being both a Motion for\nSummary Judgment and a Motion to Compel Discovery.\u201d R. Vol. 2 at 127. While\nProgressive maintains this interpretation on appeal, we note that Mohn never filed a\nstand-alone motion to compel discovery.\n3no important facts still in dispute, so Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on any\nand all claims.\u201d Id. at 358\u201359. And he observed that while Progressive was\nallegedly \u201chiding certain documents\u201d that would \u201cfurther support\u201d his claims, he\nbelieved that \u201cthe documents already produced\u201d justified granting summary judgment\nin his favor such that it would be \u201ca waste of [the] court\u2019s time and resources to\ncompel discovery of said documents.\u201d Id. at 377. But at another point he argued that\nProgressive could not \u201cshow[] the absence of a genuine issue of material fact because\n[Progressive] ha[d] not adequately produced discovery according to [Mohn\u2019s]\nrequests.\u201d Id. at 378.\nThe district court granted summary judgment to Progressive without ordering\nadditional discovery and this appeal followed.\nII. Discussion\nWe review the district court\u2019s summary judgment decision de novo, viewing\nthe factual record and making reasonable inferences from it in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Bird v. W. Valley City, 832 F.3d 1188, 1199\n(10th Cir. 2016). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there\nis no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as\na matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). \u201cTo avoid summary judgment, a party must\nproduce specific facts showing that there remains a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Branson\nv. Price River Coal Co., 853 F.2d 768, 771\u201372 (10th Cir. 1988) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n4We construe Mohn\u2019s pro se filings liberally but do not serve as his advocate.\nSee Garrett v. Selby Connor Maddux & Janer, 425 F.3d 836, 840 (10th Cir. 2005).\nA. Mohn Did Not Establish a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination Based on\nProgressive\u2019s Delay in Graduating Him from the Academy or Failure to\nPromote Him\nA plaintiff, like Mohn, who relies on circumstantial evidence has the burden\non summary judgment of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination. See\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). The district court\nconcluded that Mohn failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on\nProgressive\u2019s delay in graduating him from the academy or its failure to promote\nhim. Mohn does not advance a reasoned argument that the court erred in reaching\nthis conclusion.2 Nor does he cite any evidence that undermines it. We affirm the\ndistrict court\u2019s ruling on these issues for substantially the same reasons cited by the\ndistrict court.\nB. Mohn Did Not Establish that Progressive\u2019s Proffered Rationale for Firing\nHim Was Pretextual\nThe district court assumed, without deciding, that Mohn established a prima\nfacie case of discrimination with respect to his termination. Applying the McDonnell\n2 Mohn does claim the district court erred by requiring him to produce a\nfemale comparator to establish his prima facie case. But the district court did not\nimpose such a requirement. It instead noted that proffering comparator evidence is\n\u201c[o]ne of the ways that an employee can demonstrate circumstances giving rise to an\ninference of discrimination.\u201d R. Vol. 2 at 417. And the district court found Mohn\u2019s\nproffered comparator evidence wanting because it did not establish that the females\nMohn identified were \u201csimilarly-situated to [Mohn] in any relevant category of\nperformance.\u201d Id. at 417\u201318.\n5Douglas burden-shifting framework,3 the district court noted Progressive\u2019s proffered\nnon-discriminatory rationale for firing Mohn\u2014violating its code of conduct by\nkicking open the doors to their office, among other things. And the district court\nrejected Mohn\u2019s claims of pretext.\nMohn argues that the district court erred by failing to consider how the\ncircumstances surrounding his termination support an inference that Progressive\u2019s\nstated rationale was pretextual. These include: (1) Progressive\u2019s shifting rationale;\n(2) Progressive\u2019s delay in providing its rationale; (3) the company\u2019s deviation from\nits policy of providing a warning or discipline before termination; (4) a factfinder\u2019s\npotential disbelief of Progressive\u2019s reason for his termination; (5) Mohn\u2019s practice of\noften kicking open doors without punishment before he made claims of\ndiscrimination; (6) Progressive\u2019s policies that do not support termination for similar\nacts; and (7) Progressive\u2019s shoddy investigation. But Mohn fails to cite record\nevidence that establishes any of these facts.4 We therefore reject his argument. Cf.\nBekkem v. Wilkie, 915 F.3d 1258, 1268 (10th Cir. 2019) (\u201cMere conjecture that the\n3 Under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework, if the plaintiff\nestablishes a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to\narticulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its adverse action. See\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802. If the defendant does so, the burden shifts\nback to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s proffered rationale was pretextual.\nSee id. at 804\n4 The only evidence Mohn cites relates to his claim that company policy\nrequires a warning or discipline before termination. But the document he cites states:\n\u201cNothing contained in this policy precludes immediate termination in cases of serious\nviolations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or Our Workplace Policies.\u201d\nSupp. R. at Progressive 0000109.\n6employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext for intentional discrimination is an insufficient\nbasis for denial of summary judgment.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nMohn further appears to argue that the district court erred by failing to apply\nthe \u201cpretext plus\u201d doctrine, which requires a plaintiff to provide \u201cadditional, direct\nevidence of a discriminatory motive.\u201d Neal v. Roche, 349 F.3d 1246, 1249 (10th Cir.\n2003) (emphasis added).5 We rejected the pretext plus doctrine in Randle v. City of\nAurora, 69 F.3d 441, 451 (10th Cir. 1995), and the district court therefore did not err\nby failing to apply it.\nC. The District Court Did Not Err by Granting Summary Judgment to\nProgressive Before Ruling on Mohn\u2019s Embedded Motion to Compel\nMohn argues that the district court erred by granting summary judgment to\nProgressive without ruling on the motion to compel that he embedded in his motion\nfor summary judgment. \u201cWe review . . . the district court\u2019s . . . decision to grant\nsummary judgment before ruling on [Mohn\u2019s] motion to compel for an abuse of\ndiscretion.\u201d Skrzypczak v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Tulsa, 611 F.3d 1238, 1242\n(10th Cir. 2010).\nRule 56(d) states that if a party opposing a summary judgment motion \u201cshows\nby affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential\nto justify its opposition,\u201d the court may deny the motion, defer consideration pending\n5 While Mohn states that \u201cthe pretext-plus rule should have been applied,\u201d\nAplt. Opening Br. at 25, he does not advance a reasoned argument for its application.\nGiven that the doctrine would impose a more stringent standard on Mohn, we\nquestion whether he intended to press this argument in his pro se brief.\n7additional discovery, or take other appropriate actions. The affidavit \u201cmust explain\nwhy facts precluding summary judgment cannot be presented,\u201d \u201cidentify[] the\nprobable facts not available and what steps have been taken to obtain these facts,\u201d\nand \u201cexplain how additional time will enable him to rebut movant\u2019s allegations of no\ngenuine issue of fact.\u201d Comm. for the First Amendment v. Campbell, 962 F.2d 1517,\n1522 (10th Cir. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]here a party opposing\nsummary judgment fails to take advantage of the shelter provided by Rule 56[(d)] by\nfiling an affidavit, there is no abuse of discretion in granting summary judgment if it\nis otherwise appropriate.\u201d Campfield v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 532 F.3d 1111,\n1125 (10th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).6 An \u201cunverified assertion\nin a memorandum opposing summary judgment does not comply with Rule 56[(d)]\nand results in a waiver.\u201d Comm. for the First Amendment, 962 F.2d at 1522.\nMohn did not file a Rule 56(d) affidavit and his pro se status does not excuse\nthis failure, see Garrett, 425 F.3d at 840. In any event, his unverified response to\nProgressive\u2019s motion for summary judgment equivocated regarding whether he\nsought additional discovery. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion\nin granting summary judgment to Progressive before ruling on the discovery issues\nthat Mohn raised in his summary judgment motion.\n6 Before 2010, Rule 56(d)\u2019s provisions were codified as Rule 56(f). See\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) advisory committee\u2019s note to 2010 amendment (\u201cSubdivision\n(d) carries forward without substantial change the provisions of former subdivision\n(f).\u201d).\n8D. Mohn Does Not Develop Any Other Arguments on Appeal\nMohn also purports to appeal from the district court\u2019s rejection of his motions\nto amend his complaint. We review the \u201cdecision to deny leave to amend a\ncomplaint for an abuse of discretion.\u201d Hertz v. Luzenac Grp., 576 F.3d 1103, 1117\n(10th Cir. 2009). Mohn fails to articulate how the district court abused its discretion\nwith respect to these matters. We therefore decline to review these rulings. See, e.g.,\nKelley v. City of Albuquerque, 542 F.3d 802, 819 (10th Cir. 2008) (\u201c[P]erfunctory\u201d\nallegations of error that \u201cfail[] to frame and develop an issue\u201d are insufficient \u201cto\ninvoke appellate review.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nIII. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary\njudgment to Progressive Insurance and its denial of summary judgment to Justin\nMohn. Progressive Insurance\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied as moot in\nlight of the court\u2019s January 24, 2020 order supplementing the record.\nEntered for the Court\nNancy L.

Whether visitors must pay a fee as part of their trip is\ndetermined by the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (REA). This\nprescriptive statute details when the agencies that run and maintain our public lands\ncan and cannot impose a fee: the REA generally allows fees for developed areas but\nproscribes fees for undeveloped ones. Thomas Alpern claims that the United States\nForest Service (Forest Service) improperly charges him a fee when he enters Maroon\nValley to park and hike. He cites a REA provision that he claims prohibits charging a\nfee \u201c[s]olely for parking[.]\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A). He argues that this\nprohibition overrides another REA provision that allows agencies to charge a fee\nwhen certain listed amenities are present\u2014amenities such as picnic tables, security\npatrols, trash bins, and interpretive signs. Id. \u00a7 6802(f)(4). We disagree. Section\n6802(d)(1)(A) prohibits charging fees \u201c[s]olely for parking . . . along roads or\ntrailsides[,]\u201d something Alpern does not do. He parks in a developed parking lot\nfeaturing all the amenities listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4), not along a road or trailside. So we\naffirm the district court\u2019s decision to reject Alpern\u2019s as-applied challenge to the\nMaroon Valley fee program.\nBACKGROUND\nJust outside of Aspen, Colorado sits Maroon Valley\u2014part of White River\nNational Forest and home to the stunning Maroon Bells. The valley is popular with\nbackpackers, hikers, and campers, among others, due to its spectacular natural beauty\nand abundant outdoor recreation opportunities. Most visitors to Maroon Valley pay\n2$10 at a welcome station,1 unless they are \u201cmerely driving through\u201d or briefly\nstopping at the \u201cStein Meadow View Pullout.\u201d2 Appellant\u2019s App. at 31, 130. Ninety\npercent of the collected fees are then reinvested in Maroon Valley. Paying visitors\ncan park for up to five days in one of three developed parking lots\u2014East Maroon\nWilderness Portal, West Maroon Wilderness Portal, or Maroon Lake Scenic Area.\nEach lot provides visitors with various amenities, including bathrooms, interpretive\nsigns, and picnic tables. These lots are the only day-parking options in Maroon\nValley, meaning convenient access to its wilderness areas often requires a fee.\nAlpern hikes in Maroon Valley and the surrounding wilderness areas where he\n\u201coften go[es] on multi-day backpacking trips\u201d or day hikes exceeding twelve hours.\nAppellant\u2019s App. at 26\u201327. To do so, he enters the valley on its only road, pays the\n$10 fee, and parks in one of the three lots \u201cto access the trail[s],\u201d while claiming\nnever to use any of the lot\u2019s various amenities. Id. at 26\u201329. Based on this, Alpern\nbrings an as-applied challenge to Maroon Valley\u2019s fee program\u2014administered by the\nForest Service\u2014alleging that it violates the REA by charging him \u201c[s]olely for\nparking[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. at 5, 10\u201311 (citing 16 U.S.C \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)). The\ndistrict court rejected this challenge, ruling the fee program proper as applied to\nAlpern. Alpern v. Ferebee, No. 1:17-cv-00024-RM, 2019 WL 1046789, at *1\u20133 (D.\n1 Visitors can also enter Maroon Valley via bus between 9:00 AM and 5:00\nPM without being charged the $10 fee.\n2 Visitors are asked about their intentions at the welcome station and are\ncharged the fee only if they are going to park in one of the three developed parking\nlots.\n3Colo. Mar. 5, 2019) (citing 16 U.S.C \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)). Alpern timely appealed, and\nwe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\nDISCUSSION\nI. Standard of Review\nAlpern mounts an as-applied challenge to the fee program in Maroon Valley;\ntherefore, we apply the law \u201cto the facts of [his] concrete case.\u201d See Colo. Right to\nLife. Comm., Inc. v. Coffman, 498 F.3d 1137, 1146 (10th Cir. 2007). He argues that\ncharging him a fee to park in one of the three developed parking lots contravenes 16\nU.S.C. \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)\u2019s mandate that fees not be charged \u201c[s]olely for parking[.]\u201d\nThus, he asks us to invalidate the fee program using the authority granted to us by the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(C) (\u201c[R]eviewing\ncourt[s] shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . in\nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d).\nAnd \u201c[u]nder the [APA], which governs judicial review of agency actions, we review\nthe lower court\u2019s decision de novo.\u201d See Citizen\u2019s Comm. to Save Our Canyons v.\nKrueger, 513 F.3d 1169, 1176 (10th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted).\nII. Maroon Valley\u2019s Fee Program as Applied to Alpern\n\u201cAs a general rule Congress has decreed that anyone may enter this country\u2019s\ngreat national forests free of charge.\u201d Scherer v. U.S. Forest Serv., 653 F.3d 1241,\n1242 (10th Cir. 2011) (citing 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802(e)(2)). But federal agencies can\n\u201ccharge a standard amenity recreation fee for Federal recreational lands and waters\n4under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of\nReclamation, or the Forest Service[] . . . at the following:\u201d\n(1) A National Conservation Area.\n(2) A National Volcanic Monument.\n(3) A destination visitor or interpretive center that provides a broad range\nof interpretive services, programs, and media.\n(4) An area--\n(A) that provides significant opportunities for outdoor recreation;\n(B) that has substantial Federal investments;\n(C) where fees can be efficiently collected; and\n(D) that contains all of the following amenities:\n(i) Designated developed parking.\n(ii) A permanent toilet facility.\n(iii) A permanent trash receptacle.\n(iv) Interpretive sign, exhibit, or kiosk.\n(v) Picnic tables.\n(vi) Security services.\n16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802(f) (2018) (emphasis added and bold in original). This authority to\n\u201ccharge a standard amenity recreation fee\u201d is \u201climited by subsection (d),\u201d which\nprovides that:\nThe Secretary shall not charge any standard amenity recreation fee or\nexpanded amenity recreation fee for Federal recreational lands and waters\nadministered by the Bureau of Land Management, the Forest Service, or\nthe Bureau of Reclamation under this chapter for any of the following:\n(A) Solely for parking, undesignated parking, or picnicking along\nroads or trailsides. . . .\n(D) For persons who are driving through, walking through, boating\nthrough, horseback riding through, or hiking through Federal\nrecreational lands and waters without using the facilities and\nservices. . . .\n(F) For use of overlooks or scenic pullouts.\nId. \u00a7 6802(d)(1), (f) (emphasis added and bold in original).\nThis appeal centers on the interplay of these two provisions. Section\n6802(f)(4) allows fees at locations with all six statutory amenities present, except\n5where \u00a7 6802(d) applies. In this case, Alpern concedes that all three developed\nparking lots in Maroon Valley contain the six amenities listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4), making\nit a location where the Forest Service can charge a standard amenity fee unless\n\u00a7 6802(d)(1) applies. Alpern argues that \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A) applies, prohibiting the\nForest Service from charging a fee at that location \u201csolely for parking[.]\u201d Appellant\u2019s\nReply Br. 1. Thus, the sole question before us is whether \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)\u2019s exception\napplies to Alpern\u2019s use of the developed parking lots in Maroon Valley, making the\nForest Service\u2019s fee program unlawful as it applies to him.3\nSection 6802(d)(1)(A) prohibits \u201cthe Forest Service\u201d from charging \u201cany\nstandard amenity recreation fee . . . [s]olely for parking, undesignated parking, or\npicnicking along roads or trailsides.\u201d \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Alpern\ncontends that \u201cparking\u201d is not modified by \u201calong roads or trailsides\u201d such that this\nprovision prohibits fees \u201csolely for parking,\u201d meaning the fee is improper as applied\nto him because even though he parks in a developed lot (which is one of the six\namenities in (f)(4)), he never uses any of the other five amenities. Appellant\u2019s\nOpening Br. 17\u201318, 26. This interpretation is incorrect.\nSection 6802(d)(1)(A) contains a series\u2014\u201cparking,\u201d \u201cundesignated parking,\u201d\nand \u201cpicnicking\u201d\u2014followed by a postpositive modifier\u2014\u201calong roads or trailsides.\u201d\n3 Section 6802(f)(4) does not require the use of any of these amenities; rather,\nit allows charging a fee at \u201can area . . . that contains\u201d the listed amenities.\n\u00a7 6802(f)(4). Thus, because Alpern concedes the parking lots contain all the listed\namenities, the only way he can prevail in this appeal is if one of the \u00a7 6802(d)(1)\nexceptions applies.\n6\u201c[W]hen there is a straightforward, parallel construction that involves all nouns or\nverbs in a series, a prepositive or postpositive modifier normally applies to the entire\nseries.\u201d Potts v. Ctr. for Excellence in Higher Educ., Inc., 908 F.3d 610, 615\u201316 (10th\nCir. 2018) (quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The\nInterpretation of Legal Texts 147 (2012)).\nHere, the statute\u2019s structure leads us to conclude that each term in the series is\nmodified by \u201calong roads or trailsides.\u201d Each element is separated only by a comma,\nand no words or punctuation interrupt the series\u2019 nouns (outside of a single\nadjective). See \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A). No odd punctuation breaks up the series\u2019 flow, and\nthe series contains no determiners between terms, indicating that the postpositive\nmodifier applies to each element. \u201cThe typical way in which syntax would suggest no\ncarryover modification is that a determiner (a, the, some, etc.) will be repeated before\nthe second element[.]\u201d Scalia & Garner, supra at 148\u201349 (noting that \u201c[w]ith\npostpositive modifiers, the insertion of a determiner before the second item tends to\ncut off the modifying phrase so that its backward reach is limited\u2014but that effect is\nnot entirely clear\u201d).4 For these reasons, we conclude that the statute prevents charging\na visitor \u201csolely for parking . . . along roads or trailsides.\u201d \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A); see also\nScherer, 653 F.3d at 1243 (concluding that charging an amenity fee when a visitor\nsimply \u201cparks to have a picnic on the side of the road, and then calls it a day,\u201d is not\n4 Compare Scalia & Garner, supra at 148 (\u201cInstitutions or societies that are\ncharitable in nature (the institutions as well as the societies must be charitable).\u201d),\nwith Scalia & Garner, supra at 149 (\u201cAn institution or a society that is charitable in\nnature (any institution probably qualifies, not just a charitable one).\u201d).\n7allowed because the visitor will \u201chave paid the amenity fee only for picnicking and\nundesignated parking\u2014activities for which no fee is supposed to be charged under\n\u00a7 6802(d)(1)\u201d (emphasis added)). And because Alpern does not park along either a\nroad or trailside, instead parking in a developed parking lot, \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)\u2019s\nexception does not apply to him, even if all he does is park in the lot.\nOther REA provisions support this conclusion. For example, \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(D)\nprohibits charging a fee to certain classes of visitors who pass through a statutory-fee\narea \u201cwithout using the facilities and services.\u201d This statutory exception applies to\nvisitors who (1) drive through (without parking), (2) walk through, (3) boat through,\n(4) ride horses through, or (5) hike through. Id. Conspicuously unlisted are visitors\nwho park at a fee area and claim not to use any amenities. See id. Enumerating the\ntypes of visitors who are exempt from fees when they do not use amenities\ndemonstrates that Congress knows how to exempt visitors who do not use amenities.\nSo by not exempting visitors who park in a (f)(4)-fee area without using amenities,\nCongress allows such visitors to be charged a fee despite not using all of the\namenities. See Navajo Nation v. Dalley, 896 F.3d 1196, 1213 (10th Cir. 2018) (noting\nthat \u201cthe canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius . . . provides that the expression\nof one item of an associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned\u201d\n(alterations and citations omitted)).\nThe REA\u2019s legislative history supports this view by showing that Congress\nintended for fees to support agency investment in the corresponding fee area, while\npreserving free access to undeveloped public lands. According to the REA\u2019s House\n8Report, the Act sought \u201cto improve recreational facilities and visitor opportunities on\nfederal recreational lands by reinvesting receipts from fair and consistent recreational\nfees and passes[.]\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 108-790(I), at 12 (2004). This meant that the REA\nwould help \u201cagencies . . . raise revenues to eliminate the backlog of deferred\nmaintenance, increase the quality and quantity of visitor services, provide critical\nresource protection, and meet other high-priority needs.\u201d Id. To accomplish this, the\nREA contains \u201cspecific restrictions to ensure that any established fee would be for\nmanaged recreation purposes that contain substantial federal investment for the\nvisitor.\u201d Id. at 13. Thus, the REA allows agencies to charge visitor fees when doing\nso supports agency investment in the fee area to enhance the visitor experience\u2014such\nas by providing visitors a developed parking lot with nearby toilets, signs, trash cans,\nand picnic tables.\nIn addition to providing a revenue source to help \u201cenhance the visitor\nexperience by investing fees in improving recreation opportunities[,]\u201d the REA\u2019s\ndrafters were concerned that allowing blanket access fees would impose \u201can\nunreasonable barrier to public use.\u201d Id. For this reason, the REA \u201cwas overly\nprescriptive to alleviate concerns of those who no longer trust certain federal land\nmanagement agencies with the recreation fee authority.\u201d Id. at 14. For example, the\nREA \u201cma[kes] clear that the [the Forest Service] will not be permitted to charge\nsolely for parking, scenic pullouts, and other non-developed areas . . . .\u201d Id. In this\nway, the REA attempts to limit fees for areas where federal investment/development\nis lacking\u2014i.e., the area is non-developed. Such non-developed areas include\n9roadsides, off-trail land, and other locations in which the visitor\u2019s experience is\nenhanced solely by the outdoors, not by agency-provided amenities. This legislative\nhistory backs up the statute\u2019s plain language\u2014fees are typically allowed where\nfederal investment has occurred but not where nature is the sole attraction.\nHere, Alpern parks in a developed parking lot near toilets, picnic tables,\ninterpretive signs, and several other amenities, all of which demonstrate federal\ninvestment of the kind that would foreclose applying \u00a7 6802(d)(1)\u2019s exceptions.\nAlpern does not park in an undeveloped lot with no amenities, nor does he pull to the\nside of the road and hike from there.5 Instead, he parks in locations where fees are\nallowed\u2014\u00a7 6802(f)(4) areas\u2014and which bear the marks of substantial federal\ninvestment. So a plain reading of the REA forecloses Alpern\u2019s argument that the\nMaroon Valley fee program is invalid as applied to him.\nAs an alternative, Alpern counters that even if \u201calong roads and trailsides\u201d\nmodifies \u201cparking\u201d in \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A), he cannot be charged because by parking in\ndeveloped parking lots with trail access, he \u201cis actually parking along a trailside,\u201d\nmeaning that his activity fits within \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(A)\u2019s exception. Appellant\u2019s Reply\nBr. 6. This interpretation fails. Though the exception likely covers a visitor\u2019s pulling\nover to the roadside to hike or parking in an undeveloped lot to access hiking trails, it\ndoes not cover a visitor\u2019s parking in a developed lot with amenities. Most parking\n5 Alpern\u2019s inability to do so for this location does not matter to our decision.\nThe REA says nothing about providing free parking to visitors. And Alpern can\nalways avoid the fee by taking a bus, hitching a ride, or biking into the valley.\n10lots in public-land areas are located near trailheads. Often, that is why the lot is\nthere\u2014to allow for easy public access to the trails. Adopting Alpern\u2019s proposed\ninterpretation would render \u00a7 6802(f)(4)\u2019s allowance of fees for these areas illusory.\nWe note as well that Alpern\u2019s argument that he parks in the developed lots\nwithout using any other amenity listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4) is incomplete. The six listed\namenities in \u00a7 6802(f)(4) are: (1) a \u201c[d]esignated developed parking\u201d lot; (2) a\n\u201cpermanent toilet facility[;]\u201d (3) a \u201cpermanent trash receptacle[;]\u201d (4) an\n\u201c[i]nterpretive sign, exhibit, or kiosk[;]\u201d (5) \u201c[p]icnic tables[;]\u201d and (6) \u201c[s]ecurity\nservices.\u201d Though Alpern may choose not to use amenities (2), (3), (4), or (5), he\nadmittedly uses (1) and necessarily uses (6) because he receives the benefit of\nsecurity services by parking his car in a patrolled parking lot.\nThough Alpern does not admit using the security services, he does so every\ntime he parks in one of the three Maroon Valley lots, each of which provides the six\n(f)(4) amenities\u2014one of which is security. We see no realistic scenario in which he\ndoes not use the security services. What if a security officer notices a would-be thief\nbreaking into Alpern\u2019s car? Should the officer ignore the break-in, somehow divining\nthat Alpern has silently disavowed the use of security? Or should the officer\nintervene? Most users would expect the officer to intervene, even if they did not plan\non using security services when they parked. Now, let\u2019s assume Alpern would not\nwant the officer to intervene, how would this be accomplished? Would he need to put\na sticker on his car indicating to security officers that they should let would-be\nintruders go about their business uninterrupted? Wouldn\u2019t that just invite break-ins?\n11Or perhaps officers could refuse to intervene when a car lacks proof of paying the\nfee\u2014an approach that would also invite thieves.6 This demonstrates the difficulty that\nwould result from adopting Alpern\u2019s reading of the statute. Thus, because security, by\nits very nature, is something that provides a benefit, Alpern necessarily uses the\nsecurity services whenever he parks his car in one of the three Maroon Valley lots.\nAnd because Alpern\u2019s argument hinges on the idea that the statute prohibits fees\n\u201csolely for parking,\u201d his benefitting from security\u2014a (f)(4) service\u2014defeats his\nargument.\nThe REA allows the Forest Service to charge a fee for \u201cFederal recreational\nlands\u201d when the area includes six amenities. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802(f)(4). Nothing in the\nstatute requires using all of them. Any such requirement would be impossible to\npolice. People could easily evade the fee by claiming never to use the toilets, trash\ncans, or picnic tables. Because Alpern parks in \u00a7 6802(f)(4) parking lots, the Forest\nService has authority to charge him the user fee.7\n6 Alpern claims in his declaration that he has \u201cnever seen a Ranger Patrolling\nWest or East Maroon Portal or drive by while I am there,\u201d Appellant\u2019s App. at 27, as\nthough this indicates that security services are not provided and, thus, he does not use\nthem. But this lack of encounters with security is easily explained by other parts of\nhis declaration. For example, he often starts hiking before 6:00 AM. And he claims to\nnot use any amenities, meaning that he goes straight from his car to the trails, leaving\nlittle time in the parking lot for a chance encounter with security.\n7 Alpern concludes his Reply Brief by \u201cask[ing us] to join the Ninth Circuit\u2019s\nholdings regarding the REA and find that the Forest Service\u2019s practice of charging\nfees for users who park solely to access the undeveloped lands beyond the areas with\namenities does not comport with the REA.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 21\n(referencing Adams v. U.S. Forest Serv., 671 F.3d 1138, 1139\u201340 (9th Cir. 2012)).\nBut Alpern misunderstands the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding. Instead of providing support\n12CONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the Forest Service properly charges Alpern a fee when he\nparks in one of three developed Maroon Valley lots. Thus, we affirm the district court\nand dismiss the case.\nfor his position, Adams holds exactly what we do here: \u201cThe only place where\nparking could be the sole activity is a designated developed parking facility\u2014for\nwhich the REA authorizes standard amenity recreation fees only in conjunction with\nfive other amenities.\u201d Adams, 671 F.3d at 1145 n.13 (citing 16 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 6802(f)(4)(D)(i) (emphasis added)).\n13",
