McDaniel appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge and contends that the sentence imposed by the district court is substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm. First, McDaniel argues that Hobbs Act robbery is not a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c). Although \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague following United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2336 (2019); United States v. Simms, 914 F.3d 229, 23233, 252 (4th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 304 (2019), \u201cHobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under the force clause of [\u00a7] 924(c),\u201d United States v.

Therefore, the district court did not err in denying McDaniel\u2019s motion to dismiss. Second, McDaniel argues that the district court substantively erred because it deviated from a sentence to which it previously committed itself without providing 2adequate explanation and because the district court based its sentence on a state offense that was not relevant conduct.1 We disagree. We review a sentence \u201cfor reasonableness \u2018under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019\u201d whether the sentence \u201cis \u2018inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range.\u2019\u201d United States v.

To the extent McDaniel argues his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to explain the reason it was departing from its previous statement of the sentence it was inclined to impose, we find this argument lacks merit.

We conclude that the district court provided an adequately detailed and individualized explanation for the chosen sentence it imposed. 4We also conclude that the district court did not substantively err in selecting the sentence.

Herrera, a/k/a Rubio Herrera, Defendant - Appellant. ORDER AND JUDGMENT* Before LUCERO, BALDOCK, and MORITZ, Circuit Judges. Freddy Herrera-Rivas pleaded guilty to unlawfully reentering the United States after removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). Herrera-Rivas later moved to withdraw his guilty plea under Fed. R. Crim. P. 11, contending his original removal order was invalid. The district court denied the motion to withdraw. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm. * After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to honor the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.BACKGROUND Herrera-Rivas is a native and citizen of Mexico.

Specifically, in his proposed motion to dismiss, Herrera-Rivas contended his 2008 removal order was void 2because his 2008 NTA failed to specify a date and time for his appearance and, therefore, was defective under Pereira v.

Because the district court rejected the Pereira argument, and therefore determined a collateral attack on the 2008 removal order would be futile, the court declined to address the statutory factors for a collateral attack.

Opening Br. at 14. As our recent decisions confirm, the district court correctly determined that Pereira was inapposite and that Herrera-Rivas\u2019s jurisdictional argument lacked merit.2 The Supreme Court held in Pereira that \u201c[a] putative notice to appear that fails to designate the specific time or place of a non-citizen\u2019s removal proceedings is not a \u2018notice to appear under section 1229(a), and so does not trigger the stop-time rule.\u2019\u201d 138 S. Ct. at 2113-14. But as we recently explained in Lopez-Munoz v. Barr, 941 F.3d 1013 (10th Cir. 2019), Pereira addressed only the narrow question of \u201cwhether a defective notice to appear had interrupted a noncitizen\u2019s continuous presence in the United States\u201d for purposes of the \u201cstop-time rule\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1)(A) and \u201cdid not address the distinct question of whether a defect in the notice to appear would preclude jurisdiction over the removal proceedings.\u201d Lopez-Munoz, 941 F.3d at 1018 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Denial of a motion to amend or alter judgment under Civil Rule 59(e) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Dixon v. Wallowa Cty., 336 F.3d 1013, 1022 (9th Cir. 2003). A bankruptcy court abuses its discretion if it applies the wrong legal standard, misapplies the correct one, or makes illogical or implausible factual findings, or findings without support from the facts in the record.

The bankruptcy court acknowledged that Rodriguez had received a discharge three weeks prior to Dr. Ross filing his Stay Relief Motion, and that the discharge order discharged Rodriguez's personal liability for his prepetition debts, except for those to be determined in the adversary proceeding. Nonetheless, the court entered the Stay Relief Order granting Dr. Ross relief from the automatic stay to continue with the State Court Action. This was erroneous.

The court could not thereafter grant Dr. Ross relief from the nonexistent stay, and it abused its discretion when it did so.4 Accordingly, we must REVERSE the Stay Relief Order.5 4 Proceeding to determine Rodriguez's liability in the State Court Action also would not violate the discharge injunction. The discharge injunction does not apply to this debt, because the debt is the subject of Dr. Ross's adversary proceeding seeking a determination of its dischargeability. The bankruptcy court may ultimately hold that the debt is discharged, but until that happens, the discharge injunction does not apply. See Kvassay v.

Thus, Rodriguez has not met his burden of establishing our jurisdiction to hear the appeal as of right. The only way Rodriguez may obtain review of the Adversary Order is to seek leave to appeal. The Panel is authorized to grant leave to appeal interlocutory orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). In re Travers, 202 B.R. at 626. Rodriguez did not file a motion for leave to appeal. Instead, he requested in cursory fashion in his response that we grant leave to appeal solely on the basis that it was inequitable for the bankruptcy court to sua sponte stay the adversary proceeding pending resolution of the State Court Action. Given the lack of a proper motion and supported argument 12establishing the factors necessary for granting leave, Rodriguez has not met his burden to establish that we should grant leave under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). Since Rodriguez did not meet his burden of establishing our jurisdiction over the Adversary Order, we DISMISS the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. VI. CONCLUSION For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the Stay Relief Order, and we DISMISS for lack of jurisdiction the appeal of the Adversary Order.",

Arguably, if the Trooper opened the door to facilitate the drug-dog sweep, that conduct might be a basis for suppressing evidence. See, e.g., State v. Naranjo, 159 Idaho 258, 260, 359 P.3d 1055, 1057 (Ct. App. 2015) (ruling inquiry is whether dog\u2019s act was instinctual and whether police facilitated or encouraged act).

According to the Trooper\u2019s report: \u201cBy opening the passenger door, Caudill retrieved the paperwork I requested. Caudill also left the passenger door open.\u201d More importantly, Caudill\u2019s petition fails to allege that he informed his trial counsel that Caudill disputed the Trooper\u2019s account of the search and that trial counsel failed to act on that information. Indeed, Caudill makes no allegation of his trial counsel\u2019s purported deficient performance. To the contrary, Caudill indicated during his sentencing hearing that he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s representation. Further, Caudill did not raise the issue of who opened the passenger door during the hearing on his Rule 35 motion, despite challenging the nature of the Trooper\u2019s actions at that time. Instead, Caudill focused only on his belief that his truck did not match the description of the truck subject to the Amber Alert. Moreover, alleging that Caudill disputed the Trooper\u2019s report of the search and that Caudill shared this information with his trial counsel would not have required appointment of post-conviction counsel. Rather, these purported facts were within Caudill\u2019s personal knowledge and would not have required an investigation into facts not otherwise known to Caudill. See Melton,",

Defendant was not apprehended and brought back to Illinois until 2005, after which the State charged him by superseding indictment with multiple counts of first-degree murder and with aggravated stalking. \u00b6 6 On November 4, 2005, following a fitness hearing, the trial court found defendant fit to stand trial. The same day, the State filed a notice of its intent to seek the imposition of the death penalty. Among other aggravating factors, the State alleged that defendant had also killed Sumnear Yang on September 1, 1992. \u00b6 7 On June 29, 2007, the State and the defense indicated that they were close to a plea deal. As part of the agreement, defendant was placed under oath and was examined in open court by the State\u2019s Attorney. Defendant admitted to killing Yang and Velasquez. He admitted that the only reason that he would agree to natural life imprisonment was to avoid the possibility of the death penalty. He also admitted faking a mental illness in 1994 and again in this case. He agreed that, for purposes of entering a guilty plea, he would waive any right to appeal and to raise any issue in",

The State argues that, similarly, defendant offers no explanation as to why he waited more than two years after the abolishment of the death penalty to file his petition, rendering the petition untimely. \u00b6 38 The State additionally argues that the trial court correctly applied res judicata, because it had already ruled in the section 2-1401 proceedings that defendant had failed to show that his waiver and guilty plea were involuntary.

Finally, the State argues that dismissal is warranted even if we were to reach the merits of defendant\u2019s claims. \u00b6 39 We agree with the State that dismissal was justified because the postconviction petition was untimely, and defendant failed to allege facts showing that the delay was not due to his culpable negligence.

Of course, Banks would need to have advance authorization from the District Court before filing a civil rights complaint. His petition here is a clear attempt to circumvent the VLO.

Finding that the Appellant, Mark Blair, has not paid the $205 filing fee or shown he is excused from paying the filling fee, we dismiss the appeal for want of prosecution. On December 6, 2019, the Clerk of the Court sent Appellant a notice that he had not tendered the case filing fee of $205. The notice directed Appellant to pay the filing fee within 20 days. Appellant did not tender payment. In response, the Clerk sent a second request for payment of the case filling fee on January 2, 2020. The letter notified Appellant that failure to pay the case filing fee within twenty days could result in dismissal of the appeal for want of prosecutionpursuant to TEX.R.APP.P. 42.3(b) and (c). As of this date, Appellant has not paid the filing fee or otherwise responded to our notices regarding payment of this Court\u2019s filing fee. Pursuant to Rule 42.3(b) and (c), we dismiss this appeal for want of prosecution. See TEX.R.APP.P. 42.3(b), (c).1 GINA M.

PER CURIAM: Renee Bell, proceeding pro se, appeals the dismissal of her complaint with prejudice under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) alleging constitutional violations by the U.S. Bank National Association, the Oaks at Powers Park Homeowners Association, the Florida Highway Patrol, and several individuals. Among other things, Bell appears to contend that U.S. Bank conspired with the other defendants to fraudulently foreclose on her property and prevent her from filing for bankruptcy. On appeal, she asserts that the district court violated her constitutional rights by dismissing her complaint and that the court shouldn\u2019t have considered her complaint frivolous because decisive facts may not have emerged until discovery or trial.1 If a party fails to object to the findings or recommendations contained in an report and recommendation (R&R) after being informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences on appeal for failing to object, that party waives the right to challenge the unobjected-to factual and legal conclusions on appeal. 11th Cir. R. 3-1. Furthermore, if a pro se litigant fails to address an issue in her opening brief, that issue is deemed abandoned. Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d 870, 1 The dismissal of a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) as frivolous is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Bilal v. Driver, 251 F.3d 1346, 1348\u201349 (11th Cir. 2001).",

    "content": "874 (11th Cir. 2008). Here, Bell waived her right to challenge the district court\u2019s factual and legal conclusions because she didn\u2019t object to the substance of the R&R. She also abandoned any argument that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint with prejudice because she did not argue that issue in her brief. Additionally, we have held that a district court doesn\u2019t violate due process in dismissing a complaint under \u00a7 1915(e) where the litigant is given an opportunity to object to the R&R and the district court reviews the R&R de novo. Vanderberg v. Donaldson, 259 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir. 2001). So, to the extent that Bell argues that the dismissal violated due process, her argument fails because she was given an opportunity to object to the R&R, which the court reviewed de novo. Finally, motions to dismiss based on a facial challenge to the complaint should be resolved before discovery begins. Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., 123 F.3d 1353, 1367 (11th Cir. 1997). Therefore, to the extent that Bell asserts that she couldn\u2019t file a proper complaint without discovery, the district court determined that her claims were facially frivolous and, therefore, properly dismissed the matter before discovery. AFFIRMED.",

See Simms, 143 Ill. 2d at 174; see also Ochoa, 2017 IL App (1st) 140204, \u00b6 41. The present matter is distinguishable from People v. Virgin, 302 Ill.

Meller testified, based on Exhibit 1, that defendant was transferred to a disciplinary unit eight days after the search. Defendant contends that this testimony improperly suggests that a nontestifying prison official concluded defendant possessed contraband. \u00b6 20 We find that the court did not commit clear or obvious error in admitting this evidence. First, Exhibit 1 contained defendant\u2019s transfer information. Defendant did not object to the exhibit being entered into evidence and does not challenge its admissibility on appeal. Meller relayed that information to the court and explained that 1F is a disciplinary segregation cell block. Meller did not relay any third-party statements suggesting what precipitated the transfer. This issue can be resolved on this basis alone. \u00b6 21 Second, the fact of defendant\u2019s transfer does not necessarily implicitly assert that a nontestifying witness believed that defendant possessed contraband.

BEFORE: MCCLENDON, WELCH, AND HOLDRIDGE, JJ. WRIT GRANTED. The district court' s ruling granting the defendant' s motion to suppress is reversed. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, the officer had the authority to detain the defendant to investigate whether the defendant was truant. See La. Ch. Code. art. 733. 1. Furthermore, although an officer has no basis for suspecting a particular individual, the United States Supreme Court has held, the officer may request consent to search. See Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 435, 111 S. Ct. 2382, 2386, 115 L. Ed. 2d 389 ( 1991). Moreover, there was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing regarding the duration of the detention. Therefore, there is no evidence that the defendant' s consent to a search of his backpack was vitiated by an extensive detention. See State v. Brown, 20140220 ( La. App. 1st Cir. 9/ 24/ 14), 2014 WL 4743079. Accordingly, the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted the defendant' s motion to suppress, and this matter is remanded to the district court for further proceedings.

Much of the amount claimed related to expert witness costs and fees.

Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM: Cornell D. Wallace appeals his 77-month sentence imposed following his guilty plea to distribution of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) (2018). Counsel for Wallace has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v.

Here, the district court based its drug weight finding on hearsay statements from one of Wallace\u2019s codefendants, whom the court had sentenced previously. While the court largely credited the allegation that, for several weeks or months, Wallace sold cocaine out of the codefendant\u2019s residence, the court substantially reduced the drug quantity attributed to Wallace to account for the difficulty in determining historical drug weight with great precision. Based on our review of the record, we discern no clear error in the court\u2019s drug weight calculation. Next, Anders counsel generally questions the reasonableness of Wallace\u2019s sentence. However, we conclude that the district court correctly calculated Wallace\u2019s Guidelines range, afforded the parties an opportunity to argue for an appropriate sentence, and considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at a downward variance sentence. Furthermore, nothing in the record rebuts the presumption of substantive reasonableness accorded Wallace\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence. See United States v. Louthian, 756 F.3d 295, 306 (4th Cir. 2014). In accordance with Anders, we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Wallace\u2019s criminal judgment. This court requires that counsel inform Wallace, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review.

(Filed: February 7, 2020) OPINION* * This disposition is not an opinion of the full Court and, pursuant to I.O.P. 5.7, does not constitute binding precedent.SHWARTZ, Circuit Judge. Joseph Coleman was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Coleman appeals, arguing the District Court erred in admitting a recording that was inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Because the evidence was properly admitted, we will affirm. I Law enforcement received information from a confidential informant (\u201cCI\u201d) that Coleman sold firearms. The CI agreed to contact Coleman to purchase a gun. The CI arranged the purchase with Coleman via text message. In one message, Coleman told the CI that he had \u201ca few joints,\u201d meaning firearms, for sale. App. 44. The pair corresponded about the types of firearms and their prices, and they agreed to meet. Before the meeting, law enforcement searched the CI to ensure he did not possess any contraband or firearms. The CI was then \u201coutfitted with a recording device,\u201d and he drove to",

Their entire meeting was recorded. During the meeting, the CI and Coleman discussed several firearms that Coleman could provide to the CI. The CI then purchased a 9-millimeter firearm from Coleman for $400. After the purchase, the CI placed the gun in the trunk of his car and drove Coleman to a nearby convenience store to buy cigarettes. During the car ride, Coleman described other guns he sold, as well as those he had in his possession. Coleman also described various sexual encounters, spoke about women in a degrading manner, and talked about territorial conflicts he had with others in the area. After their meeting, the 2CI met the investigators, who retrieved the firearm from the trunk of the car. They also searched the CI once more, again finding no contraband. A grand jury returned a one-count indictment, charging Coleman with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Coleman filed a motion in limine to exclude the portion of the recorded conversation that transpired after the sale of the firearm because it captured a discussion between Coleman and the CI about firearms sales and other activities not included in the indictment. He argued that these discussions were irrelevant under Rule 401, prejudicial under Rule 403, and inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The District Court ruled in limine that the",

The Government played the limited recording at trial during the testimony of both the officer handling the investigation and the CI. On cross-examination, Coleman challenged the CI\u2019s credibility and asserted that the CI possessed the gun before meeting with Coleman and lied about purchasing it from him. In short, Coleman sought to insinuate that the CI had planted the gun on Coleman. When the CI\u2019s testimony was complete, the Government asked the District Court to reconsider its ruling precluding evidence of Coleman\u2019s statements about other firearms he sold and had available for purchase. The Government asserted that, in light of Coleman\u2019s apparent defense that the CI had fabricated the gun sale, the remainder of the recording was admissible to show Coleman\u2019s intent to sell weapons, his motive for 3meeting with the CI, and his general practice of selling firearms.

Before sentencing, it was revealed that defendant had a prior conviction in Alexander County for aggravated unlawful use of a weapon (AUUW), a Class 2 felony, based on section 24-1.6(a)(2), (a)(3)(A) of the Criminal Code of 2012 (Code) (720 ILCS 5/24-1.6(a)(2), (a)(3)(A) (West 12012))\u2014a facially unconstitutional statutory provision\u2014in case number 12-CF-39.

Defendant, therefore, requests this court to vacate his prior AUUW conviction and remand for a new sentencing hearing.

According to the information, defendant entered Jeremy Riggs\u2019 residence in Cairo, Illinois, knowing Riggs to be present, and intentionally caused injury to Riggs by stabbing him in the hand with a knife. Defendant obtained private counsel, and the case proceeded to a jury trial on April 26, 2016. The following facts were taken from the evidence presented at the three-day trial. \u00b6 5 At trial, Riggs and his fianc\u00e9, Tiffany Bennett, testified to the following details and events surrounding the January 5, 2015, incident. Riggs and Bennett were at their shared residence when two or three masked intruders forcibly entered through the front door and demanded money. When Riggs resisted their demand and reached for his pocketknife, one intruder began striking Riggs repeatedly in the head with a gun, while the other intruders wrestled the knife away from Riggs. Both Bennett and Riggs 2identified defendant as one of the intruders because Bennett grabbed his mask and exposed defendant\u2019s face during the struggle. In addition, Riggs and Bennett lived in the same neighborhood as defendant and they had spoken with him on occasion. During the struggle, Bennett was struck in the head and fled through the rear door to seek help from a nearby relative. Riggs sustained a head laceration",

Defense counsel also pointed out that the sentence sought by the State was greater than a customary sentence for a murder conviction. Defense counsel requested that the circuit court impose concurrent six-year sentences for the home invasion and aggravated battery charges. \u00b6 11 Before addressing the factors in aggravation, the State discussed defendant\u2019s criminal history.

However, defendant did not properly preserve this claim for review, as he failed to both contemporaneously object and file a written postsentencing motion raising the issue. See People v. Hillier, 237 Ill. 2d 539, 544 (2010); see also Ill. S. Ct. R. 605(a)(3)(C) (eff.

We reject defendant\u2019s assertion that he has not waived review of this claim because the law changed after his sentencing hearing. Defendant acknowledges that, prior to his sentencing hearing, our supreme court had declared the statute unconstitutional under which he was convicted of 8AUUW (Mosley, 2015 IL 115872, \u00b6 61), and clarified that a void AUUW conviction may be vacated by filing a proper pleading. McFadden, 2016 IL 117424, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.

Because defendant failed to do so, his claim is forfeited unless he establishes plain error.

People v. Reed, 2018 IL App (1st) 160609, \u00b6 56.

In turn, the State argues that defendant has failed to show plain error because the court imposed a sentence that was within the statutory range and was not primarily based on his prior AUUW conviction. \u00b6 21 As the State correctly notes, defendant was convicted of home invasion, which is a Class X felony with a sentencing range of 6 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment.

People v. Stacey, 193 Ill. 2d 203, 209 (2000).

McHugh Submitted under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a) on November 14, 2019 Before: JORDAN, SCIRICA and RENDELL, Circuit JudgesO P I N I O N* RENDELL, Circuit Judge: This case concerns a high-speed police chase that ended with Appellant Police Officer Christopher Narkin shooting and wounding Appellee John Fuller. Fuller sued Narkin under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for excessive use of force. Narkin appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss Fuller\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim. For the following reason, we will dismiss this interlocutory appeal for lack of jurisdiction. I. Background On October 16, 2014, Fuller led Officer Narkin on a high-speed chase through Norristown, Pennsylvania while driving a semi-trailer truck. The chase ended when Fuller crashed into a guardrail and disabled the truck. Fuller alleges that after the crash, he raised his arms in surrender and did not \u201cengage[] in any threatening behavior.\u201d A. 26. According to Fuller, Narkin fired three shots after he had surrendered, one of which struck him in the arm. Fuller brought a \u00a7 1983 action against Narkin, alleging excessive force in violation of his rights under the Fourth",

John Roosevelt Baccus, Appellant Pro Se. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM: South Carolina state prisoner John Baccus appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for a writ of mandamus. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2018). The magistrate judge recommended that Baccus\u2019 petition be summarily dismissed. The district court, noting that it had not received objections from Baccus, accepted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and dismissed Baccus\u2019 petition. Although we express no opinion regarding the merits of Baccus\u2019 suit, we vacate the dismissal and remand for further proceedings.

ZAHRA, J. (dissenting). I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s application for leave. Because the Court of Appeals failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness credibility,1 I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages and remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages award.2 Defendant contracted with plaintiff to provide Information Technology work for Gordon Food Service (GFS) from October 2012 through February 8, 2014 (referred to as the \u201cfirst engagement\u201d). The contract included a noncompete agreement that expired on August 8, 2015. Defendant violated the noncompete agreement by soliciting work from GFS. Specifically, in June 2015, plaintiff contacted GFS so as to arrange additional work for defendant, but it learned that defendant had already directly solicited and obtained employment at GFS (referred to as the \u201csecond engagement\u201d). 1 See MCR",

The more difficult issue was determining damages. The Court of Appeals provided this summary: During the first GFS engagement, GFS paid [plaintiff] $160 per hour of services; [plaintiff] in turn paid [defendant] $115 an hour, leaving [plaintiff] with a profit of $45 per hour. After six months, GFS increased the pay rate to $180 per hour. [Plaintiff] paid [defendant] $130 an hour, for a profit of $50 per hour. Under both pay rates, [plaintiff] retained 28% of the GFS payment. During the second GFS engagement, [defendant] worked for a different GFS department. Under this contract, GFS paid [defendant] $150 per hour. And from June 2015 through the time of trial, [defendant] had worked a total of 2,896 hours.[3] The Court of Appeals also summarized the disagreement about damages related to defendant\u2019s work during the second GFS engagement: [Plaintiff] provided evidence that it",

Accordingly, [plaintiff] asserted, its share of the payments during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement would have been \u201cpure profit.\u201d Overall, [plaintiff] sought $180,800 in damages.[4] The trial court \u201ctook judicial notice that [plaintiff]\u2019s overall profit margin was 12.5% and determined to award [plaintiff] only 12.5% of the payments [plaintiff] would have retained during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement, a total of $22,600.\u201d5 The trial court ruled that \u201cthis [c]ourt\u2019s measure of damages is the . . . profit margin that [plaintiff] would have made on [defendant]\u2019s job starting on June 8th of . . . 2015 and continuing through the four months, through May 25th of 2017 . . . .\u201d The Court of Appeals vacated the $22,600 damages portion of the trial court judgment and instead remanded the case for entry of a judgment awarding plaintiff $147,588 in damages for lost profits.

To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was required to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second GFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial, [defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours per week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s work would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16 weeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and adding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of 3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours of work. The value of the hours then becomes critical to determining [plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that GFS paid $150 per hour under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying the total number of hours worked (3,514) by this hourly rate amounts to a total of $527,100\u2014i.e., the total value of the second GFS engagement was $527,100.

[Plaintiff] would not have been entitled to the entire $527,100, as it would have been required to turn a portion of this amount over to [defendant] as his compensation. Accordingly, the trial court was next required to calculate how much of the total contract value would have flowed into [plaintiff]\u2019s pockets. To arrive at this figure, it is appropriate to consider past dealings between the parties involved. As noted, the undisputed evidence shows that [plaintiff] retained 28% of GFS\u2019s payment during [defendant]\u2019s first GFS engagement. The evidence of these previous dealings allowed [plaintiff] to prove its damages with reasonable certainty. Health Call of Detroit [v Atrium Home & Health Care Servs, Inc, 268 Mich App 83, 96 (2005)]. The proper measure of damages was 28% of the value4 of the contract for the second GFS engagement; 28% of $527,100 amounts to a total of $147,588 in lost profits.[6] In my view, the discrepancy between the trial court and the Court of Appeals is attributable to determination of overhead. Plaintiff maintained there would was no overhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100% profit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly rejected the testimony that supported this contention.

The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for the net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable.

The Commission\u2019s authority to revoke a liquor license is separate from a court determining whether an ordinance has been violated. The Commission has no authority to grant an injunction, and as the trial court noted on the record, it does not have jurisdiction regarding revocation of a liquor license until a decision has been rendered by the liquor control commissioner and all administrative remedies available in appealing that decision are exhausted. Here, the court explicitly excluded any issue relating to the defendant\u2019s liquor license. The court\u2019s order applied only to those counts related to the violation of the Code by the defendant.

Columbia Municipal Code \u00a7 17.28.010(A) (amended May 16, 2012).

He argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. For the following reasons, we affirm. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-ofdiscretion standard. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of demonstrating that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and the substantial deference afforded to sentencing courts. United States v. RosalesBruno, 789 F.3d 1249, 1256 (11th Cir. 2015). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step inquiry, first ensuring that there was no significant procedural error, and then examining whether the sentence was substantively reasonable. United States v. Sarras, 575 F.3d 1191, 1219 (11th Cir. 2009). We evaluate substantive reasonableness by considering the totality of the circumstances and whether the sentence achieves the sentencing purposes stated in \u00a7 3553(a). Id.

We may not presume that a sentence outside the guideline range is unreasonable and must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as a whole, justify the extent of the variance. Rosales-Bruno, 789 F.3d at 1254\u201355. A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum penalty is an indicator of a reasonable sentence. See United States v. Gonzalez, 550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Here, King fails to demonstrate that his 168-month total sentence is substantively unreasonable; we see no abuse of discretion. To start, King concedes that the district court explained its reasoning for the sentence and the upward variance in open court. Nevertheless, he argues that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court placed too much emphasis on the fact that he placed a gun to the victim\u2019s head, which made all other factors virtually irrelevant. Not so. Contrary to King\u2019s assertion, the district court placed great emphasis on not just one, but at least three factors: King\u2019s criminal history, the fact that he committed the offense while on probation, and the fact that he put a firearm to the back of the victim\u2019s",

Here, the district court did not err in denying Black\u2019s motion to suppress. For starters, Black did not have standing to challenge the September 9, 2016, search of the car he was borrowing, and, thus, could not have prevented the fraudulent credit cards within it from entering evidence. The record shows that, at most, Black was a passenger of the borrowed Infiniti; the Infiniti was registered in someone else\u2019s name, he did not pay to use it, and he could not exclude others from using it. Accordingly, Black did not have a possessory interest in the Infiniti, and, therefore, did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the vehicle\u2019s driver door\u2019s pocket where the fraudulent credit cards were found. Lee, 586 F.3d at 864-65. Moreover, because he did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the borrowed car, his discussion of other case law is without merit. The district court was also correct to deny Black\u2019s motion to suppress other evidence seized on September 9. As the record reveals, on September 3, 2016, Officer Daniel Ford entered a \u201cprobable cause pickup order\u201d (\u201cPCP\u201d) for Black, based on Officer Ford\u2019s claims that he saw Black driving on a suspended license and that Black had fled to elude him after Black ran a stop sign and crashed a car.

Black claims that his warrantless arrest on September 9, 2016, pursuant to the PCP, was unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment and, thus, any evidence obtained through that arrest should be suppressed. We are unpersuaded by Black\u2019s claims, however, because Officers Simpkins and Lambeth effectuated a lawful warrantless arrest in a public place. As for Black\u2019s argument that Officers Simpkins and Lambeth should have obtained an arrest warrant before arresting him because they had time to do so, the Supreme Court rejected this argument in Watson. See 423 U.S. at 423. As for Black\u2019s argument that arresting him pursuant to a PCP was unreasonable, Black has overstated the role the PCP had in his arrest. As the Supreme Court has made clear, the Fourth Amendment permits a warrantless arrest in a public place if law enforcement officers have probable cause to believe that a felony has occurred. White, 526 U.S. at 565; Watson, 423 U.S. at 423-34.

OCWEN LOAN SERVICING, LLC, 16-1229 Appellant/Appellee, 16-1238 v. OPINION CHRISTOPHER MICHAEL MARINO; VALERIE MARGARET MARINO, Appellees/Appellants. Appeal from the Ninth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel Faris, Lafferty III, and Tighe, Bankruptcy Judges, Presiding Argued and Submitted October 22, 2019 San Francisco, California Filed February 10, 20202 IN RE MARINO Before: J. Clifford Wallace and Mary H. Murguia, Circuit Judges, and Robert S. Lasnik,* District Judge. Opinion by Judge Lasnik SUMMARY** Bankruptcy The panel dismissed, for lack of jurisdiction, appeals from the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel\u2019s decision affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s contempt orders issued against a creditor and reversing and remanding on the issue of punitive damages; and affirmed the BAP\u2019s denial of debtors\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. Dismissing in part for lack of jurisdiction, the panel held that the BAP\u2019s decision remanding the matter to the bankruptcy court was not final and appealable. Considering the need to avoid piecemeal litigation, judicial efficiency, the systemic interest in preserving the bankruptcy court\u2019s role as the finder of fact, and whether delaying review would cause any party irreparable harm, the panel concluded that all four of these factors compelled dismissal of the creditor\u2019s appeals. *",

Unlike Ocwen\u2019s appeals, the Marinos\u2019 appeal only raises the frivolousness of Ocwen\u2019s appeal to the BAP, an issue that is both final and discrete. We have jurisdiction over the Marinos\u2019 appeal and review it for abuse of discretion. See Shapiro ex rel. Shapiro v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. No. 69, 374 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir. 2004) (citing Fischel v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the U.S., 307 F.3d 997, 1005 (9th Cir. 2002)). The Marinos point to three sources that they believe entitle them to attorney\u2019s fees: (1) Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38,2 (2) the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the deed of trust with Ocwen, and (3) section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. We address each purported basis for an award of attorney\u2019s fees in turn. First, under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38, we may award damages and single or double costs to an appellee if we determine that an appeal is",

United States, 908 F.2d 408, 411 (9th Cir. 1990) (per 2 More precisely, the BAP may award just damages and single or double costs to an appellee as a sanction for a frivolous appeal from a bankruptcy court\u2019s judgment under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8020(a).

The BAP did not clearly err in finding that the appeal was not frivolous and did not abuse its discretion by declining to sanction Ocwen under Rule 38. The Marinos are not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 38. Second, the attorney\u2019s fees provision in the Marino\u2019s deed of trust with Ocwen only allows Ocwen to receive attorney\u2019s fees for \u201ca legal proceeding that might significantly affect [its] interest in the Property and/or rights under [the deed],\u201d including bankruptcy. That provision is reciprocal pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1717(a) when either party seeks to enforce or avoid enforcement of the deed.

Accordingly, we will not award fees under the deed of trust. Third, and finally, the Marinos argue that they should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees under section 105(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. But that would require us to overturn our decision, In re Del Mission Ltd., 98 F.3d 1147 (9th Cir. 1996), in which we held that section 105(a) does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees.

First, because no provision plainly prohibited or mandated above-scale wages, the arbitrator properly considered evidence extrinsic to the CBA, including Greif\u2019s thirteen-year practice of paying such wages to deserving employees. See Edward Hines Lumber Co. of Or. v. Lumber & Sawmill Workers Local No. 2588, 764 F.2d 631, 633, 635 (9th Cir. 1985) (upholding an award that precluded the company from subcontracting more than 40% of its operations, notwithstanding a management rights clause and the absence of an \u201cexpress provision regarding subcontracting,\u201d where the arbitrator \u201cclearly based his decision in large part on the employer\u2019s undisputed historical practice of maintaining a 60\u201340 ratio\u201d of bargaining unit employees to subcontractors). Based on this practice, which persisted under materially similar predecessor CBAs, the arbitrator concluded that the above-scale wages were an implied term of the CBA. He reasonably declined 3to infer an agreement to eliminate those rates from adjustments made to the wage scale in 2016, as those adjustments resulted from brief, friendly negotiations that did not address above-scale wages.

ZAHRA, J. (dissenting). I disagree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny defendant\u2019s application for leave. Because the Court of Appeals failed to defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of witness credibility,1 I would reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals as to damages and remand this case to the Oakland Circuit Court for reinstatement of its damages award.2 Defendant contracted with plaintiff to provide Information Technology work for Gordon Food Service (GFS) from October 2012 through February 8, 2014 (referred to as the \u201cfirst engagement\u201d). The contract included a noncompete agreement that expired on August 8, 2015. Defendant violated the noncompete agreement by soliciting work from GFS. Specifically, in June 2015, plaintiff contacted GFS so as to arrange additional work for defendant, but it learned that defendant had already directly solicited and obtained employment at GFS (referred to as the \u201csecond engagement\u201d). 1 See MCR",

The more difficult issue was determining damages. The Court of Appeals provided this summary: During the first GFS engagement, GFS paid [plaintiff] $160 per hour of services; [plaintiff] in turn paid [defendant] $115 an hour, leaving [plaintiff] with a profit of $45 per hour. After six months, GFS increased the pay rate to $180 per hour. [Plaintiff] paid [defendant] $130 an hour, for a profit of $50 per hour. Under both pay rates, [plaintiff] retained 28% of the GFS payment. During the second GFS engagement, [defendant] worked for a different GFS department. Under this contract, GFS paid [defendant] $150 per hour. And from June 2015 through the time of trial, [defendant] had worked a total of 2,896 hours.[3] The Court of Appeals also summarized the disagreement about damages related to defendant\u2019s work during the second GFS engagement: [Plaintiff] provided evidence that it",

Accordingly, [plaintiff] asserted, its share of the payments during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement would have been \u201cpure profit.\u201d Overall, [plaintiff] sought $180,800 in damages.[4] The trial court \u201ctook judicial notice that [plaintiff]\u2019s overall profit margin was 12.5% and determined to award [plaintiff] only 12.5% of the payments [plaintiff] would have retained during [defendant]\u2019s second GFS engagement, a total of $22,600.\u201d5 The trial court ruled that \u201cthis [c]ourt\u2019s measure of damages is the . . . profit margin that [plaintiff] would have made on [defendant]\u2019s job starting on June 8th of . . . 2015 and continuing through the four months, through May 25th of 2017 . . . .\u201d The Court of Appeals vacated the $22,600 damages portion of the trial court judgment and instead remanded the case for entry of a judgment awarding plaintiff $147,588 in damages for lost profits.

To calculate [plaintiff]\u2019s loss, the circuit court was required to determine the value of [defendant]\u2019s contract for the second GFS engagement. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that at the time of trial, [defendant] had worked 2,896 hours for GFS, for an average of 38.61 hours per week. Other uncontroverted evidence established that [defendant]\u2019s work would continue for at least another four months, or 16 weeks, under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying 38.61 hours per week by 16 weeks amounts to an additional 617.76 hours. Rounding that number and adding it to the hours [defendant] had already worked amounts to a total of 3,514 hours. The second GFS engagement was therefore worth 3,514 hours of work. The value of the hours then becomes critical to determining [plaintiff]\u2019s lost profits. [Plaintiff] presented evidence that GFS paid $150 per hour under the second GFS engagement. Multiplying the total number of hours worked (3,514) by this hourly rate amounts to a total of $527,100\u2014i.e., the total value of the second GFS engagement was $527,100.

[Plaintiff] would not have been entitled to the entire $527,100, as it would have been required to turn a portion of this amount over to [defendant] as his compensation. Accordingly, the trial court was next required to calculate how much of the total contract value would have flowed into [plaintiff]\u2019s pockets. To arrive at this figure, it is appropriate to consider past dealings between the parties involved. As noted, the undisputed evidence shows that [plaintiff] retained 28% of GFS\u2019s payment during [defendant]\u2019s first GFS engagement. The evidence of these previous dealings allowed [plaintiff] to prove its damages with reasonable certainty. Health Call of Detroit [v Atrium Home & Health Care Servs, Inc, 268 Mich App 83, 96 (2005)]. The proper measure of damages was 28% of the value4 of the contract for the second GFS engagement; 28% of $527,100 amounts to a total of $147,588 in lost profits.[6] In my view, the discrepancy between the trial court and the Court of Appeals is attributable to determination of overhead. Plaintiff maintained there would was no overhead and that the referral fee for the second GFS engagement would have been 100% profit. The trial court understandably found this contention dubious and expressly rejected the testimony that supported this contention.

It is within the purview of the trier of fact to determine credibility, and great deference is given to the fact-finder on that issue.

The use of the 12.5% profit margin properly accounted for the net profit loss. In my view, the trial court\u2019s methodology was proper and reasonable.

The following day, Griffin admitted to filling a beer bottle with gas with the intent to do the same. A gas station employee saw Griffin with the open 1container filled with gas and called the police. A magistrate subsequently found probable cause and the prosecutor filed an information charging arson in the third degree and attempted arson in the third degree. Prior to trial, the State moved to exclude the testimony of Griffin\u2019s proposed expert witness whose testimony would address the inability for concrete to burn. Griffin argued the testimony was relevant because one cannot attempt to commit a crime that cannot be committed. The district court granted the motion, determining impossibility is not a defense for an attempt charge. Thereafter, the parties entered into a conditional plea agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, Griffin would plead guilty to one count of attempted arson in the third degree while the remaining charge would be dismissed. Griffin reserved his right to appeal the district court\u2019s determination on the impossibility defense.

Griffin argues the district court erred in excluding proposed testimony regarding a defense of impossibility. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm. I.

The charges arose after Griffin used a \u201cMolotov cocktail\u201d on the sidewalk outside the Bannock County Courthouse.

    "content": "Griffin argues the district court erred in excluding his proposed expert and any testimony regarding a defense of impossibility. Specifically, he asserts there cannot be an attempt to commit a crime that cannot be committed. Based on this Court\u2019s precedent, the district court held that factual or legal impossibility is irrelevant for purposes of Idaho\u2019s attempt statute.1 See State v. Glass, 139 Idaho 815, 818, 87 P.3d 302, 305 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Curtiss, 138 Idaho 466, 467, 65 P.3d 207, 208 (Ct. App. 2002). Griffin argues that because cement is not combustible it is impossible for him to have attempted to burn the sidewalk and therefore it is not possible for him to be guilty of attempted arson. The State asserts there is no impossibility defense to an attempt charge and the evidence was properly excluded. The district court 1 Idaho Code \u00a7 18-306. 2correctly determined the same. Factual or legal impossibility is not relevant to a determination of the defendant\u2019s guilt of attempt. Glass, 139 Idaho at 818, 87 P.3d at 305. Griffin concedes as much in his briefing. Given this precedent and Griffin\u2019s lack of argument otherwise, we hold the district court did not err in excluding Griffin\u2019s proposed expert witness. IV.",

Kimberly Oliver and Charles Best, Jr. were granted an irreconcilable-differences divorce, and Kimberly was granted sole physical custody of their child and child support.

While there, Kimberly was free of mortgage, rent, and utility expenses. Kimberly subsequently remarried and moved to Virginia, where she is now responsible for monthly mortgage and utility payments. \u00b64. Kimberly filed a motion with the chancery court, seeking additional support to supplement the growing expenses associated with raising a teenage daughter. Kimberly testified that the costs of raising K.O.B. increased with her age: K.O.B. quickly outgrew her clothing and shoes, and K.O.B. was active in extracurricular activities that entailed additional fees and expenses. Kimberly requested that the child support be increased to at least fourteen percent of Charles\u2019 income\u2014around $3,000 per month. \u00b65. Also presented at the hearing was uncontested evidence that Charles\u2019 annual income had increased from $211,000 to $260,000.

See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 893.13. On appeal, Alexander argues that these crimes cannot be \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d that trigger the career-offender designation under the Sentencing Guidelines because (1) the more serious offense of Florida cocaine trafficking is not considered a controlled substance offense, and (2) the Florida statute defining his offenses, \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes, does not contain a mens rea requirement as to the illicit nature of the substance involved. These arguments are foreclosed by the plain language of the Sentencing Guidelines and by binding precedent. We review de novo the question whether a defendant qualifies as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. United States v. Pridgeon, 853 F.3d 1192, 1198 n.1 (11th Cir. 2017).

In interpreting these provisions, we apply the usual rules of statutory construction, beginning with the plain language of the guideline. United States v. Shannon, 631 F.3d 1187, 1189 (11th Cir. 2011). In Shannon, therefore, we held that a conviction for Florida cocaine trafficking involving only the purchase of cocaine was not a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) because the purchase of cocaine \u201cdoes not necessarily give rise to actual or constructive possession\u201d of the drug under Florida law, and the act of purchasing cocaine is not covered by the plain language of the guideline. Id. at 1188\u201390. We noted that a violation of the same Florida drug trafficking statute that involved possession with intent to distribute cocaine\u2014rather than purchase with intent to distribute\u2014would meet the definition of a controlled substance offense. Id. at 1190 & n.3. Contrary to Alexander\u2019s argument, whether a prior state felony is a controlled substance offense for purposes of the career-offender guideline depends on whether the state offense meets the definition of that term in \u00a7 4B1.2(b)\u2014not on the seriousness of the offense or the severity of the penalty under state law. Cf. id. at 1190\u201391 (Marcus, J., specially concurring). In United States v. Smith, we determined that a violation of \u00a7 893.13(1) of the Florida Statutes\u2014which provides that, with",

ORDER AND JUDGMENT* Before HARTZ, KELLY, and MATHESON, Circuit Judges. In October 2015, Keystone Learning Services (\u201cKeystone\u201d) hired Mark Brown as a substitute teacher to teach English to special education students. It terminated him in December 2015 when it hired a permanent teacher, and rehired him for a different substitute teacher position from January to May 2016. Keystone did not rehire Mr. Brown for the 2016-17 school year. In April 2017, Mr. Brown sued Keystone for racial discrimination and retaliation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000(e) et seq., and 42 * This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

PER CURIAM. Edi Montes-Gutierrez pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 2. The district court1 sentenced Montes-Gutierrez to 135 months of imprisonment, below the 168 to 210 month range recommended by the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) and calculated by the district court. When determining the Guidelines range, the district court determined MontesGutierrez\u2019s base offense level was 38 due in part to the amount of methamphetamine involved in his offense. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (providing drug quantity table for determining base offense level). This conclusion was dependent on testimony by an informant, who claimed Montes-Gutierrez and another man had provided him approximately fifteen pounds of methamphetamine. On appeal, Montes-Gutierrez argues the district court wrongly credited the informant\u2019s testimony about the amount of drugs he bought from Montes-Gutierrez and thus improperly calculated the offense level and Guidelines range.",

DISCUSSION Defendant argues that the case should be dismissed because this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. In short, Defendant argues that under the relevant statutes, there is no jurisdiction because Mr. Solis is challenging a denial of an adjustment of status while there is a pending removal proceeding with respect to Mr. Solis. Def.\u2019s Mot. at 5\u20137. Mr. Solis, in response, contends that because there is no pending removal proceeding and because he seeks review of a purely legal matter, this Court has jurisdiction. The Court addresses the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme, and how it has been applied in this context, before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments here. 4Some background on the relevant statutory and regulatory scheme provides context for the parties\u2019 arguments. The Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) created a process, called \u201cadjustment of status,\u201d by which \u201ccertain aliens physically present in the United States could seek lawful permanent resident status without having to depart this country.\u201d Landin-Molina v. Holder, 580 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir. 2009). However, in cases in which an alien who is not an arriving alien \u201chas been placed in deportation proceedings or in removal",

    "content": "An illustrative example is 11Hosseini v. Johnson, 826 F.3d 354 (6th Cir. 2016). The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court, which had concluded that it lacked jurisdiction in a case challenging the denial of an adjustment of status application. Id. at 357\u201359. But the plaintiff in Hosseini did not, at any point, have any removal proceedings initiated against him. Id. at 361. The government argued that the fact that the agency could, at some hypothetical future time, bring removal proceedings against the plaintiff meant that the agency\u2019s denial was not sufficiently final. Id. at 361\u201362. The court rejected that argument. See id. In particular, the court was concerned that because the agency had discretionary control over whether to initiate removal proceedings, precluding review of a plaintiff\u2019s claim could allow the agency to control whether a claim might be brought before the courts. See id. at 362. Other courts have found the same. See, e.g., Mamigonian, 710 F.3d at 945 (explaining that Ninth Circuit has made clear \u201cthat for purposes of the APA, \u2018[w]ithout a pending removal proceeding, a denial of status adjustment is final because there is no appeal to a superior administrative authority\u2019\u201d (quoting Cabaccang, 627 F.3d at 1317)); Pinho, 432 F.3d at 201 (finding that when there were no removal proceedings, plaintiff \u201chad no further opportunity to challenge the legality of the decision within the agency, and would have none at all, were he forced to await deportation",

In response, Mr. Solis argues that this Court has jurisdiction because \u201cno removal proceedings are currently pending.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 2. He concedes that removal proceedings were initiated against him in 2002 and that he was ordered removed in 2002. Id. However, he explains, because there are no ongoing removal proceedings, jurisdiction lies. See id. The Court agrees with Defendant. What Mr. Solis\u2019s primary argument overlooks is that, under the legal scheme outlined above, the question is whether he has exhausted administrative remedies. It is true that in many cases, including the case that Defendant cites several times, Jafarzadeh v. Duke, 270 F. Supp. 3d 296 (D.D.C. 2017), there were parallel removal proceedings happening at the same time as the district court case. But Mr. Solis in this case still has not exhausted his administrative remedies because he has not sought to move to reopen his removal proceedings so that his adjustment of status application can be adjudicated there. Mr. Solis must avail himself of any administrative remedies available to him, which includes seeking adjudication of his adjustment of status application in a reopened removal proceeding. As noted above, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1245.2(a)(1)(i), the Immigration Judge presiding over any removal proceeding has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status\u201d that an alien may file.

Dec. 103, 106\u201307 (BIA 2009), would apply to his application. Indeed, in In re Yauri, there was neither a dispute that the alien was an arriving alien nor a finding by USCIS that she was not an arriving alien. See id. at 104 (noting that alien \u201cacknowledge[d] that she [was] an \u2018arriving alien\u2019\u201d). In any event, it is far from clear that In re Yauri should be accorded deference. For instance, the Ninth Circuit held in Singh v. Holder, 771 F.3d 647 (9th Cir. 2014), that \u201cthe Board of Immigration Appeals has authority to reopen proceedings of an alien who is under a final order of removal in order to afford the alien an opportunity to pursue an adjustment of status application before [USCIS],\u201d id. at 649. In doing so, it accorded no deference to In re Yauri because it found that the Board\u2019s holding in that case ignored \u201cthe unambiguous language of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), which states that \u2018[t]he Board may at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in 14which it has rendered a decision.\u2019\u201d Id.

Dr. Yapp\u2019s initial approach or \u201cpass\u201d into plaintiff\u2019s stomach was by way of the endoscope, which has a camera and a light at its tip that gives the physician visibility as to the contents of the stomach. On the first pass, Dr. Yapp saw the flipper in plaintiff\u2019s stomach and took two pictures of it with the camera at the tip of the endoscope. Dr. Yapp saw that the flipper posed a danger to plaintiff as it had multiple sharp edges and \u201ca wire almost like a fishhook.\u201d The flipper was over two and a half centimeters in length, meaning that it would be difficult to remove. Dr. Yapp believed that the best way to remove the flipper without harming plaintiff was to utilize a bell-shaped, latex hood, about five centimeters in diameter, that would cover the flipper during its removal from plaintiff\u2019s body. \u00b6 16 Dr. Yapp withdrew the endoscope from the initial pass and fit the hood over the scope.

Complexity because it is an area, whereas you navigate the endoscope and the foreign object, they both have to turn with the esophagus otherwise there could be laceration and perforation? A. It\u2019s high risk. Q. And it\u2019s in that area where [plaintiff] was lacerated and punctured? A.

Dr. Catalano drew the diagram of the esophagus, diaphragm and stomach and explained how the esophagus includes the lower esophageal sphincter, which is a complex muscle inside the stomach.

Centeno-Rosales\u2019 argument that the IJ did not impose a filing deadline was not raised on appeal to the Board.

We also conclude that, after reviewing the independent evidence, Centeno-Rosales\u2019 status as a suspected gang member and the warrant for his arrest based on his failure to appear in court for a hearing to address the charge of gang membership does not compel a finding that he will be persecuted on account of a protected ground. Lastly, while the agency gave short shrift to Centeno-Rosales\u2019 independent evidence in denying his eligibility for protection under the CAT, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the finding that Centeno-Rosales failed to show that the Salvadoran government intended to torture him. See Oxygene v. Lynch, 813 F.3d 541, 550 (4th Cir. 2016) (adopting intent standard for CAT claims as announced in In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 291 (B.I.A. 2002)).

We will deny the petition. I. Nouledo is a citizen of Togo who entered the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 2012. He has since been convicted of two crimes, but only one of them is relevant here. In 2016, Nouledo was convicted of indecent exposure to a person less than 16 years old in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b).1 On the basis of that conviction, the Government charged Nouledo with removability for, inter alia, having been convicted of a \u201ccrime of child abuse\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) sustained the charge. Nouledo applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture.

The IJ denied Nouledo\u2019s applications. The IJ concluded that Nouledo failed to corroborate his claim of having been persecuted and tortured in the past but that, even if 1 Subsection (a) defines the crime of indecent exposure, and subsection (b) is a grading provision that makes indecent exposure a first-degree misdemeanor only if the victim was less than 16 years old. Nouledo\u2019s record of conviction shows that he pleaded guilty to and was sentenced for a first-degree misdemeanor under this statute.

Nouledo appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which dismissed his appeal on the merits essentially for the reasons given by the IJ. Nouledo now petitions for review.2 II. On review, Nouledo has not raised any specific challenge to any of the BIA\u2019s rulings and the arguments that he does raise are largely inapposite. Nevertheless, we will liberally construe his pro se brief as raising three issues. Each lacks merit. First, Nouledo challenges the BIA\u2019s ruling that his criminal conviction renders him removable. The BIA, however, properly concluded that Nouledo\u2019s conviction of indecent exposure to a person less than 16 years old in violation of 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b) constitutes a removable \u201ccrime of child abuse\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 The Government removed Nouledo to Togo while this petition was pending, but his removal does not render it moot. See Pieschacon-Villegas v. Att\u2019y Gen., 671 F.3d 303, 309 n.5 (3d Cir. 2011). Thus, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a).

Dec. 503, 512 (BIA 2008). This Court has recognized that the phrase child abuse \u201cis meant to address conduct that is criminal,\u201d and therefore has found it \u201cappropriate to define the phrase \u2018child abuse\u2019 under the INA to capture conduct that poses a particular likelihood of harm to the child.\u201d Zhi Fei Liao v. Att\u2019y Gen., 910 F.3d 714, 721 (3d Cir. 2018). A conviction under 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7 3127(a) and (b) categorically qualifies.

The BIA\u2019s rulings on those applications, however, is supported by substantial evidence. Nouledo 4claims to fear persecution and torture in Togo on the basis of his political activities there over 12 years ago. The BIA concluded that the record did not support his claim, and our review of the record does not compel a contrary conclusion. In particular, the 2016 Human Rights Report for Togo states that \u201c[t]here were no reports the government or its agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killing\u201d (A.272), \u201c[t]here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances\u201d (id.), \u201cthere were no reports that government officials employed [torture]\u201d (A.273), and \u201c[t]here were no reports of political prisoners or detainees\u201d (A.277). Finally, Nouledo argues that various equitable factors, such as his family ties to the United States, weigh against removal. As the BIA explained, however, Nouledo was not eligible for any relief on the basis of such considerations. In particular, Nouledo was not eligible for a hardship-based waiver under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h) (Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 212(h)) because that section does not permit the waiver of removability under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).

PER CURIAM. Deon Goldsmith pleaded guilty to two counts of using a communication facility1 in the commission of a felony offense. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), (d)(1). The 1A \u201ccommunication facility\u201d is defined as \u201cany and all public and private instrumentalities used or useful in the transmission of writing, signs, signals,district court2 sentenced him to 46 months in prison. On appeal, Goldsmith challenges the denial of a pretrial suppression motion and argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We affirm. Goldsmith did not properly preserve the first of his two challenges. Guilty pleas are \u201cpresumptively unconditional\u201d and waive any \u201cnon-jurisdictional defects and defenses\u201d to a conviction. United States v. Limley, 510 F.3d 825, 827 (8th Cir. 2007). There is an exception: a criminal defendant can, \u201c[w]ith the consent of the court and the government, . . . reserv[e]\u201d the right to appeal the denial of a \u201cspecified pretrial motion\u201d in \u201cwriting.\u201d Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). But this case does not fall within it. Goldsmith has a written plea agreement, but it is missing any reference to his suppression motion.",

Subsequently, on April 4, 2012, Appellant filed a petition for writ of coram nobis. The trial court construed the filing to be another PCRA petition, and dismissed it as untimely on May 4, 2012. Once again, this Court affirmed the ruling on appeal and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied review. Commonwealth v. Walker, 816 WDA 2012 (unpub. memo. at 1-3) (Pa. Super. Jan. 18, 2013), appeal denied, 69 A.3d 243 (Pa. 2013). Appellant filed the present PCRA petition, his fifth, on April 4, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the PCRA court provided Appellant with notice of its intent to dismiss the petition without first conducting an evidentiary hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 907. Thereafter, the court dismissed the petition by order filed May 29, 2019. Appellant filed a response to the PCRA court\u2019s Rule 907 notice, but it was not received by the court until May 30, 2019. This timely appeal followed.3 Appellant raises three issues on appeal. First, he contends the PCRA court erred when it dismissed his petition without first appointing counsel or considering his pro se response to the court\u2019s Rule 907 notice. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3. Second, Appellant argues the court erred when it dismissed his petition without addressing his claim that trial counsel conceded his guilt to 3 Although not ordered to do so by the PCRA court, Appellant filed a",

Pa.R.Crim.P. 904(C). As noted above, this is Appellant\u2019s fifth request for post-conviction relief. Nevertheless, Rule 904(D) and (E) permit a PCRA court to appoint counsel to an indigent petitioner filing a second or subsequent petition when either \u201can evidentiary hearing is required\u201d or \u201cthe interests of justice require it.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 904(D), (E).

Although it does appear Appellant\u2019s response was timely filed pursuant to the prisoner mailbox rule,4 his objections to the court\u2019s order are aptly raised in his brief on appeal. Accordingly, Appellant is entitled to no relief on his first claim.

First, Appellant maintains he suffered a \u201cgross stru[ctur]al constitutional error\u201d when trial counsel admitted to the jury that Appellant was guilty of robbery. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. Relying upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in McCoy v. Louisiana, 138 S.Ct. 1500 (2018), Appellant argues trial counsel may not concede his client\u2019s guilt. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22. Appellant insists he is entitled to PCRA relief because he filed his petition within one year of the McCoy decision, which Appellant maintains constituted a newly discovered fact pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(ii), or a newly recognized constitutional right pursuant to Subsection (b)(1)(iii). We disagree. In McCoy, the United States Supreme Court concluded trial counsel was ineffective when, in an effort to spare his client the death penalty, he admitted to the jury the defendant committed the murders, despite the defendant\u2019s adamant objection to any admission of guilt. McCoy, 158 S.Ct. at 1505.

WESTBROOKS, J., FOR THE COURT: \u00b61. Don Lewis pleaded guilty to fondling a child and was sentenced to fifteen years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with four years to serve and eleven years of post-release supervision (PRS). It was later alleged that Lewis had violated the terms of his PRS. The Pearl River County Circuit Court held a revocation hearing and revoked Lewis\u2019s PRS. Lewis filed a motion for post-conviction relief (PCR), claiming his probation was unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s motion. Aggrieved, Lewis appeals. After reviewing the record, we reverse and remand to the circuit court for an evidentiary hearing.FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY \u00b62.

He was sentenced to fifteen years in the MDOC\u2019s custody, with four years to serve and eleven years of PRS. Lewis was also ordered to pay a $1,500.00 fine and $654.00 in restitution. In May 2015, an MDOC supervising officer alleged that Lewis violated the terms of his PRS by being arrested once for simple-assault domestic violence and twice for DUI, as well as for failing to pay his fines. The circuit court held a revocation hearing. \u00b63. At the revocation hearing, Lewis admitted to the arrests. No further testimony was provided concerning them, and the record includes no other information about them. Regarding the fines, the record is equally unclear. At the close of the hearing, the circuit court found Lewis \u201cguilty,\u201d revoked his PRS, and reinstated the seven-year and five-month balance of his sentence. On March 28, 2018, Lewis filed a PCR motion claiming that his probation had been unlawfully revoked. The circuit court denied Lewis\u2019s PCR motion on June 5, 2018. Lewis filed his notice of appeal on July 2, 2018. \u00b64. Lewis raises five issues on appeal, but they can be properly addressed with two questions.

DISCUSSION OF ISSUES AND ANALYSIS I. Section 47-7-37 \u00b66. Lewis argues that he should benefit from the 2018 amendment to section 47-7-37. The amendments changed the focus in revocations to the number of prior revocations, rather than the number of technical violations. For Lewis to benefit,1 the amendment would have to be applied retroactively to his revocation hearing in June 2015. Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-19-1 (Rev. 2015) provides as follows: No statutory change of any law affecting a crime or its punishment or the collection of a penalty shall affect or defeat the prosecution of any crime committed prior to its enactment, or the collection of any penalty, whether such prosecution be instituted before or after such enactment; and all laws defining a crime or prescribing its punishment, or for the",

Lewis provided the only testimony at his revocation hearing. No further evidence or details concerning the arrests were provided.

The instant case is factually similar to Brown in that the only basis for the revocation of Lewis\u2019s PRS is his own admission that he was arrested. The circuit court did not conduct any evidentiary inquiries of Lewis or anyone else. After Lewis admitted to being arrested, the circuit judge asked the following question, \u201cYou, also, had a guilty conviction on drug charges in 1993. And by your own admission, your mother\u2019s check is paying your fees and fines and she\u2019s having to keep you in compliance with probation. I have one question for you. What good are you to anybody?\u201d Lewis attempted to explain and answer the question concerning the fines by stating he had lost his job. The circuit judge asked no further questions but instead stated the following, \u201cIt seems to me, if you want to know my honest opinion, your mother would be a lot better off with you in the penitentiary. Your probation is revoked. That way, she doesn\u2019t have to pay your fees and fines.\u201d The circuit court failed to reference any evidentiary or factual basis for revoking Lewis\u2019s PRS because of the status of his fines. In fact, the only information contained in the transcript, as evidenced by the exchange between the circuit judge and Lewis, arguably demonstrates that the fines were current.

Petitioner Xing Wang Lin, a native and citizen of the People\u2019s Republic of China, seeks review of a November 21, 2017, decision of the BIA affirming a March 22, 2017, decision of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying him asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).

The agency did not err in concluding that Lin failed to satisfy his burden of proving past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his attendance at a church service that police raided in 2014 and his continued religious practice. 2A valid past persecution claim can be based on harm other than threats to life or freedom, including \u201cnon-life-threatening violence and physical abuse,\u201d Beskovic v.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir. 2006). Because Lin did not have any interaction with police during the raid on his church and he did not suffer harm in China, he did not suffer past persecution. See id.; see also Mei Fun Wong v. Holder, 633 F.3d 64, 72 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201cWe have emphasized that persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).

Etherton, 2017 IL App (5th) 140427, \u00b6 15. Here, defendant was convicted of criminal sexual sexual assault, a Class 1 felony, which carries a sentencing range of 4 to 15 years in prison. 720 ILCS 5/11-1.20 (West 2014). \u00b6 33 At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, defense counsel presented evidence in mitigation that defendant had a child who he financially supported, defendant had been consistently employed, and defendant\u2019s criminal background consisted only of a 2003 DUI. The trial court noted that defendant \u201cpresents as an upstanding citizen,\u201d stating that he worked hard and supported his child. Defense counsel also argued that defendant was inebriated on the night in question, resulting in a lack of judgment. Nevertheless, the trial court had to weigh those mitigating factors against the seriousness of the crime. Defendant was convicted of penetrating A.D.\u2019s vagina with his penis, while she was asleep and unable to consent. A.D. had to go to the hospital, submit to a rape kit and STD test, take a morning-after pill, and take antibiotics.

However, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that the new evidence did not demonstrate prima facie eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) was not \u201cillogical, implausible, or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the record.\u201d1 United States v.

The BIA properly considered the arguments and evidence submitted in support of Zewdu\u2019s CAT claim. 2First, the BIA did not improperly discount the affidavits submitted in support of Zewdu\u2019s motion to reopen with regard to (1) Zewdu\u2019s political activity, (2) the conditions in Ethiopia, or (3) the extent to which Oromo and Amhara individuals are targeted.

Second, Zewdu failed to produce evidence of an individual risk or harm.2 Notably, Zewdu did not present any new evidence of threats to him or his family. Finally, the worsening conditions did not materially affect Zewdu\u2019s claim for asylum based on his political opinion and ethnicity. Despite worsened human rights conditions in Ethiopia, Zewdu failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that his circumstances have materially changed since his previous proceeding. 2 Zewdu argues that the BIA should have considered his claim as one of a pattern and practice of persecution, thereby lessening the threat of individual persecution he needs to establish. However, the BIA properly rejected any claim that Zewdu was a member of a disfavored group or that there was a pattern or practice of persecution. See Wakkary v. Holder, 558 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir. 2009). Even though the record shows the Ethiopian government targets politically active Oromo and Amhara citizens, this evidence is insufficient to establish a pattern and practice of persecution. See id. at 1060-62 (holding that widespread discrimination was insufficient to show pattern and practice of persecution even where there were some incidents of persecution). 3PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.",

Moreover, the record belies Wallace\u2019s assertion. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 2/27/19, at 6. At the PCRA hearing, appellate counsel testified that she chose to forego the sufficiency claims on direct appeal in order to focus on Wallace\u2019s strongest and most viable claim, which related to the alleged deprivation of his right to testify. Id. Although she found the sufficiency challenges to be non-frivolous, appellate counsel believed that it would be more beneficial for Wallace if she zealously argued what she perceived to be his strongest claim. Id. Appellate counsel had concerns that the detailed, fact-heavy analysis necessary to argue insufficiency of the evidence would have overshadowed and detracted from the stronger issue on appeal. Id. - 6 -J-S68016-19 The Supreme Court of the United States has explicitly held that counsel need not, and indeed should not, raise every non-frivolous claim on appeal. Smith v.

There was sufficient evidence to prove Wallace guilty of both terroristic threats and intimidation of a witness or victim where Wallace directly and indirectly threatened to commit crimes of violence against the victim and attempted to guilt, manipulate, and intimidate her into dropping the charges against him and absenting himself from court proceedings.

As discussed, the evidence supports a reasonable inference of defendant\u2019s actual possession of the weapon, and it also supports the State\u2019s theory of constructive possession. \u00b6 31 The State argues that defendant had constructive possession because his presence in the back seat gave him \u201cimmediate and exclusive control\u201d of the seat pocket where Butur found the gun.

He also suggests that Davis was the person who actually exercised dominion over the gun. \u00b6 33 In his reply brief, defendant further argues that his \u201cfurtive\u201d movements have explanations other than possessing the gun, such as his adjusting his clothing. He argues that mere proximity is not sufficient evidence of intent to exercise control over contraband, so that, without the evidence that the State seeks to draw from the \u201cfurtive\u201d movements, the location of the gun does not support an inference that he intended to exert control over it. \u00b6 34 Defendant argues finally that People v.

Police removed the two older children, John Doe I and John Doe II, from Doe\u2019s care after substantiating a report that 1Doe had bruised the eldest child\u2019s upper lip while covering his mouth to stifle his crying.

    "content": "upper lip while covering his mouth to stifle his crying. The two children were then placed in the protective custody of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. Case plans were developed for Doe and the children\u2019s fathers.1 While the child protection case was pending, John Doe III was born. Because Doe had made little progress on her case plan, Doe III was also taken into the Department\u2019s protective custody. The State eventually filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Doe and the children\u2019s fathers. Neither father contested the termination of his parental rights. Following trial, the magistrate court terminated Doe\u2019s parental rights after finding clear and convincing evidence that she had neglected the children and that termination is in their best interests.2 Doe appeals. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW On appeal from a decision terminating parental rights, this Court examines whether the decision is supported by substantial and competent evidence, which means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243, 245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009). In a termination proceeding, due process and the substantial evidence test requires the trial court\u2019s findings be supported by clear and convincing evidence. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 769 (1982); Doe v. Doe, 143 Idaho 343, 346, 144 P.3d 597, 600 (2006); State v. Doe, 143 Idaho 383, 386, 146 P.3d 649, 652 (2006). Clear and convincing evidence is generally",

Specifically, Doe asserts that the magistrate court failed to give proper consideration to the children\u2019s lack of permanent placement at the time of trial and Doe\u2019s potential to reunify with the children if given adequate mental health services. The State responds that the magistrate court\u2019s decision to terminate was correct and had proper evidentiary support. We affirm the magistrate court\u2019s decision. As alluded to above, Doe does not challenge the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion that the State established a statutory ground for termination or that the children were in the Department\u2019s custody for fifteen of the past twenty-two months. Thus, our only task is to review the magistrate court\u2019s conclusion that termination is in the children\u2019s best interests. Once a statutory ground for termination has been established, the trial court must next determine whether it is in the best interests of the child to terminate the parent-child relationship. In re Aragon, 120 Idaho 606, 611, 818 P.2d 310, 315 (1991). When determining whether termination is in the child\u2019s best interests, the trial court may consider the parent\u2019s history with substance abuse, the stability and permanency of the home, the unemployment of the parent, the financial contribution of the parent to the child\u2019s care after the child is placed in protective custody, the improvement of the child while in foster care,",

The magistrate court concluded that terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights is in the children\u2019s best interests due to her complete disengagement from parenting, unwillingness to access available services to improve her situation, and the risk that she may physically abuse the children. In support of this conclusion, the magistrate court found that Doe had injured the eldest child while attempting to stifle his crying. The magistrate court further found that Doe took no steps to improve her parenting skills, made no progress on her case plan during the course of the protection case, and failed to demonstrate she had obtained stable housing or income. Despite 3repeated offers of visitation, Doe visited the children only once. Consequently, the magistrate court found that there remained a risk that Doe would abuse the children again if placed back in her care.

Additionally, the children needed therapy services when they came into the Department\u2019s custody. The two older children suffered speech delays and aggression issues while the younger child required physical therapy to address an issue with his neck. Despite Doe\u2019s lack of participation in their therapy, the magistrate court found that the children showed significant improvement while in foster care. Doe does not challenge the above-described findings. Rather, Doe first argues that the magistrate court failed to consider that leaving the children in her custody was the surest and quickest route to provide the children with permanency and stability. Although the children had yet to receive a permanent adoptive placement at the time of the termination trial, they were in a pre-adoptive placement and were wellbonded with those foster parents. It is possible that these potential parents will decline to adopt the children; however, that does not mean the children\u2019s permanency and stability would be better served by leaving the children in Doe\u2019s custody. The magistrate court\u2019s findings related to Doe\u2019s disengagement with the children, lack of progress on her case plan, and failure to demonstrate either a stable income or housing undermine the assertion that Doe was a viable avenue to provide permanency and stability to the children.

Doe\u2019s alternative argument--that the magistrate court failed to take adequate consideration of her potential to reunify with the children if given in-home mental health treatment--is also unavailing. The magistrate court found that Doe demonstrated an inexplicable unwillingness to engage the outside world during the child protection case. After the children were taken into the Department\u2019s custody, Doe expressed fears and anxiety about leaving her home and riding in cars. Doe\u2019s case worker responded by referring Doe for an initial mental health evaluation in her home. Despite Doe\u2019s inability to identify any specific symptoms of mental illness, the evaluator found that Doe suffered from mild depression. Although the Department offered Doe additional mental health services, she failed to follow up on the offer. Doe asserts that \u201cit seems reasonable\u201d that she could complete a case plan that provided her in-home mental health services.

PER CURIAM. David Rodish pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute at least 500 grams of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), and 846. The charge followed Rodish\u2019s arrest for his part of a large methamphetaminedistribution conspiracy in the greater Des Moines area dealing with several pounds of methamphetamine and hundreds of thousands of dollars. The suggested Guidelines range based on Rodish\u2019s criminal history was 141 to 177 months. At sentencing, Rodish sought a downward variance to the statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months and the government sought a sentence of 141 months, the bottom of the Guidelines range. The district court1 sentenced Rodish to 130 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Rodish challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, claiming the district court erred in failing to appropriately balance the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of certain mitigating factors such as the nature of his prior criminal convictions (specifically that a majority of his",

Moreover, as the district court noted, the trial court struck the prior consistent statements of two witnesses after defense counsel objected and instructed the jury to disregard them. Gross v. Graham, No. 9:14-CV-00768-JKS, 2016 WL 11621787, at *7 (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2016) (\u201c[C]ontrary to Gross\u2019s contentions in his Petition, defense counsel was successful in having the statements struck from the record.\u201d). For these reasons, we find that Gross is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Next, we turn to Gross\u2019s freestanding innocence claim. \u201cThe Supreme Court has not finally resolved the issue of whether there is a federal Constitutional right to be released upon proof of actual innocence.\u201d Friedman v. Rehal, 618 F.3d 142, 159 (2d Cir. 2010).

Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 417 (1993). While the Supreme Court has not articulated the standard for a freestanding innocence claim, it has suggested that it would require more convincing proof of innocence than the standard articulated in Schlup v. Delo, which requires a movant to demonstrate that, \u201cin light of new evidence, \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019\u201d House v.

After reviewing the evidence as a whole, we conclude that Gross has not demonstrated that the newly discovered evidence would be sufficient to satisfy the high standard for a freestanding innocence claim contemplated in Herrera.

With respect to the bank fraud charge, the information alleged that, from September 2014 to June 2016, Boone had engaged in a scheme to defraud two federally insured banks and that, during the fraud scheme, he fraudulently obtained a $13,200,000 loan. For the conspiracy charge, the information alleged that, from March 2004 to December 2014, Boone had bribed a Norfolk city councilman with cash, dinners, and beach house access in exchange for votes on city ordinances that benefitted Boone\u2019s businesses. 2On September 16, 2016, Boone pleaded guilty to both charges in the information pursuant to a plea agreement with the United States Attorney.

Here, the plain language of the plea agreement between Boone and the United States Attorney provides that Boone waives his right to appeal \u201cany sentence within the statutory maximum . . . on any ground whatsoever.\u201d See Supp. J.A. 4. Boone thus waived his right to appeal any sentence that was authorized by law and imposed by the district court for the offenses underlying the plea agreement.

We are therefore satisfied that the appeal waiver would encompass an appeal from the court\u2019s September 8, 2017 order imposing the Driving Condition as a term of supervised release.

Indeed, the plea agreement provides that Boone\u2019s sentence might include a term of supervised release. Accordingly, 11the Driving Condition falls within the \u201cany sentence\u201d language of the appeal waiver. For those two reasons \u2014 (1) the appeal waiver applies to the sentence fixed at the probation revocation hearing, and (2) the Driving Condition is part of \u201cany sentence\u201d within the meaning of the appeal waiver \u2014 an appeal from the September 8, 2017 order imposing the Driving Condition would fall within the appeal waiver. 2. With that understanding, the question becomes whether Boone presenting his challenge to the Driving Condition in an appeal from the denial of a motion to modify his conditions of supervised release allows him to avoid the appeal waiver. And it plainly does not. As the Third Circuit has explained, a ruling otherwise would permit a defendant to perform an \u201cend run around\u201d an appeal waiver. See United States v. Wilson, 707 F.3d 412, 415 n.2 (3d Cir. 2013). For that very reason, courts have concluded \u201cthat an appeal from a denial of a defendant\u2019s motion . . . to modify the terms of supervised release imposed as part of the original sentence falls within the scope of the defendant\u2019s appe[al] waiver.\u201d Id.

On October 7, 2015, Countryman met a Matrix employee, Fred Mahe, at the Sunflower Property for purposes of conducting an inspection. Mahe concluded that there was significant hail damage to the Sunflower Property that needed to be repaired. 4At a board meeting in late October of 2015, Countryman presented the information she had received from Matrix and received approval from the Board to hire Matrix and proceed with filing a claim with Owners for the hail damage. On November 19, 2015, the Board met and executed a written contract with Matrix. Under the terms of that contract, Matrix was to receive 10% of any amount paid by Owners to Sunflower. Countryman in turn hired R3NG to help Matrix establish the scope of the damage and the amount of the claim to be submitted to Owners.

On December 20, 2015, Sunflower notified its insurance agent regarding the damages resulting from the storm. Owners, after learning of the damages, responded by hiring an independent adjuster named Gary Stevens. Stevens met Ford at the Sunflower Property and, after examining the Sunflower Property, agreed on the scope of damage that was sustained by the Sunflower Property. On May 4, 2016, Ford sent Owners a \u201cSworn Statement In Proof of Loss\u201d that included the estimate that was prepared by Ford and Domecq. Sondra Kalcevic, the board president, signed the statement.

After receiving Sunflower\u2019s statement, Owners hired an engineer and a building consultant to assist in reviewing the statement.

More specifically, she could not differentiate between hail damage from the September 2014 storm and prior hail storms in 2009 and 2012. Stevens, the independent adjuster hired by Owners, ultimately concluded that the replacement cost value of the damage to the Sunflower Property was $857,233.89, and that the actual cash value was",

Sunflower argued that Owners could not prove that the date Sunflower had alleged it first discovered the hail damage was false, or that Sunflower intended Owners to take any specific action as a result of the date of discovery. Sunflower also argued that Owners could not prove that the R3NG/Ford estimate of damages was a material fact or that Owners was ignorant of its falsity.

On September 17, 2018, approximately one month prior to trial, the parties filed three sets of proposed jury instructions.

Domecq, for his part, had no explanation for numerous categories of damages alleged in the proof of loss and, on several occasions, conceded that certain charges listed in the proof of loss were unjustified.

Ultimately, and perhaps most damaging to Sunflower, Domecq conceded that the multiple errors that Owners identified in his proof of loss could reasonably suggest that the errors were intentional rather than random.

He also, on several occasions, conceded that certain charges listed in the proof of loss were unjustified.

The district court held that Plaintiffs could not make a claim against SCI Cal under \u00a7 2810.3 for on-call liability based on Serenity\u2019s labor violations. The court reasoned that \u00a7 2810.3\u2019s definitions of \u201cclient employer,\u201d \u201clabor contractor,\u201d and \u201cusual course of business\u201d all \u201creference work that is performed.\u201d Id. at *17 (emphasis in original). In particular, the \u201cusual course of business\u201d for which the client employer obtains or is provided labor is work \u201cperformed within or upon the premises or the worksite of the client employer.\u201d Id. (quoting Cal. Lab. Code \u00a7 2810.3(a)(6)). This qualifier excluded liability for on-call time against SCI Cal because the time a driver spent awaiting a dispatch call to \u201cany Serenity client\u201d was not work \u201c\u2018performed on the premises or worksite\u2019 of SCI.\u201d Id. at *19, *17 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, common questions did not predominate in a sub-class defined as all drivers \u201cmade available\u201d to SCI Cal. Id. at *19; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Although an individual driver who performed labor for SCI Cal, and was not merely \u201cmade available\u201d by being on call for Serenity, could potentially show liability under \u00a7 2810.3, such an inquiry would be highly individualized. 4We hold that given the language of \u00a7 2810.3 and its legislative history, see Serenity, 2018 WL 3646540, at *18, the district court did not abuse its discretion.

In the relevant period, Serenity had about eighty regular clients, and SCI Cal comprised less than fifteen percent of Serenity\u2019s business during at least part of this time. Although SCI Cal may be liable for the time during which Plaintiffs \u201cperformed\u201d labor for it, the district court did not err in its bottom-line conclusion that \u00a7 2810.3 does not impose liability for the time during which members of the putative class, many of whom may have never actually completed a dispatch for SCI Cal during any given shift, awaited a dispatch to any one of Serenity\u2019s many clients. The court\u2019s determination of the scope of liability under \u00a7 2810.3 was not a premature merits ruling, but the type of \u201crigorous analysis\u201d of Rule 23 requirements that, in appropriate cases, district courts properly conduct in a class certification decision.

    "content": "2018, the parties disputed whether the additional lump-sum alimony plaintiff calculated and paid to defendant was accurate for 2015 through 2017. The parties engaged counsel to resolve the dispute but were unsuccessful. Plaintiff insisted defendant owed him a credit and refused to pay the additional alimony until she paid the sum. Defendant filed a motion to enforce litigant's rights to recover the lump sum alimony she purported was owed. We focus on the parties' dispute regarding the 2015 alimony calculation, which is related to this appeal. In her motion, defendant included the 1122 RSUs in her calculation of plaintiff's gross 2015 earnings and calculated his income to be $429,609.69. Pursuant to the MSA, to determine plaintiff's 2015 additional lump sum alimony obligation, defendant subtracted $220,000 and the value of the 200 RSUs attributable to her. She divided the net figure by 33.3%, yielding $59,728.77 as the additional lump sum alimony. She subtracted $13,367.65, which plaintiff previously paid for 2015, leaving $46,361.12 outstanding. 3 A-2370-18T3Plaintiff's calculations differed. Utilizing the same total earnings of $429,609.69, he subtracted the total value of the 1122 RSUs, other expenses, and the $220,000 yielding $19,224. Dividing this sum by one-third, plaintiff netted $6408 as the additional lump sum amount. He reasoned because he had paid defendant $13,367, she owed him $69592, representing an overpayment.

The first issue is whether Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) are \u201cretirement funds\u201d and thus eligible for exemption under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C) when the accounts were created and maintained by his ex-wife and Lerbakken\u2019s interests resulted from a divorce decree. In Clark, the Court defined \u201cretirement funds\u201d as \u201csums of money set aside for the day an individual stops working.\u201d Clark, 573 U.S. at 127. The Court focused on three significant legal characteristics of ordinary retirement funds. Id. at 125. Account holders of ordinary retirement funds (1) are able to make additional contributions to the funds, (2) are not obligated to withdraw the funds, and (3) must pay a penalty to withdraw the funds at any time, for any purpose, prior to the age of 59 \u00bd. Id. at 128. Ultimately, \u201cretirement funds\u201d are \u201cfunds objectively set aside for one\u2019s retirement,\u201d not \u201ca pot of money that can be freely used for current consumption.\u201d Id. at 128-29. III. As for the IRA, Lerbakken\u2019s most cogent argument is that the Internal Revenue Code says that an IRA transferred incident to divorce is \u201ctreated as an individual retirement account of such [recipient] spouse, and not of such [donor] individual.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(d)(6). Lerbakken then reasons that an IRA transferred incident to divorce necessarily satisfies the legal characteristics of an ordinary IRA. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 127.

Second, state law obligates Lerbakken to withdraw his conditional interest in the IRA. Lerbakken\u2019s interest is defined by state law. See Butner v. United States, 440 U.S. 48, 55 (1979) (holding that, absent a contrary federal interest, \u201c[p]roperty interests are created and defined by state law\u201d). The governing state law\u2014the dissolution decree and the court-ordered attorney\u2019s lien\u2014define Lerbakken\u2019s interest as a debt owed to Sieloff.

Lerbakken advances four broad arguments. First, he says that the BAP and the bankruptcy court misapplied Clark by limiting the \u201cretirement funds\u201d exemption \u201cto individuals who create and contribute funds into the retirement account.\u201d In re Lerbakken, 590 B.R. at 897 (discussing the ordinary usage of retirement funds as excluding funds set aside for retirement by a different person). As Clark says, the key 5Because Lerbakken\u2019s conditional interest in the 401(k) is not \u201cretirement funds,\u201d this court need not address the \u201ccovered account\u201d requirement. See Clark, 573 U.S. at 131. See also 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(3)(C). -7-features of \u201cretirement funds\u201d are the objective legal characteristics. Clark, 573 U.S. at 125, 128-29. As discussed, Lerbakken\u2019s interests in the IRA and 401(k) do not have the necessary legal characteristics. Second, Lerbakken argues that the similar tax treatment of transferred and surviving-spouse IRAs necessitates treating accounts transferred incident to divorce the same as accounts inherited by surviving spouses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(d)(3)(C)(ii), (d)(6). However, the Court suggests that even a surviving spouse\u2014which Lerbakken is not\u2014does not have \u201cretirement funds\u201d when the surviving spouse does not roll over the IRA into his own IRA.

We note, in resolving defendant\u2019s first probation violation the court imposed a $500 fine. Also, the court\u2019s order on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss or revoke fines vacated the balance owed at the time the order was entered but did not vacate the imposition of any prior fines. Thus, the court\u2019s order in no way vacated the prior application of bond money to previously assessed fines, fees, and costs. Accordingly, we conclude defendant is not entitled to a refund of his bail bond deposit. Based on this conclusion, we also find that, even assuming the trial court erred in conducting the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion without defendant being present, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.",

The court found that petitioner was not credible in that she was neither honest nor forthcoming about her financial situation. The court\u2019s credibility finding was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. \u00b6 22 Moreover, given the trial court\u2019s findings, we are compelled to conclude that the court\u2019s decision to deny petitioner permanent maintenance was not an abuse of discretion. Petitioner was awarded more assets than respondent; nothing indicated that the parties lived a lavish lifestyle; the marriage lasted less than five years; and neither party was healthy. Although respondent allegedly - 7 -2020 IL App (2d) 190358-U promised to always take care of petitioner, the court concluded that that promise was not valid. Respondent never testified that he made such a promise, and even if he had, it is difficult to conclude that respondent truly intended to take care of petitioner well after their relationship had soured, rather than just during the marriage. \u00b6 23 Petitioner argues that she should have been awarded permanent maintenance, because both parties testified that she was disabled. We disagree. The fact that both parties believed that petitioner was disabled did not mean that the court had to accept that belief as fact. Moreover,",

The court noted during trial that it would afford the proper weight to testimony that petitioner was disabled, noting that no evidence other than the parties\u2019 testimony was presented on that issue. See, e.g., Kraft Foods, Inc. v. Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board, 2013 IL App (2d) 121031, \u00b6 58 (rejecting proposition that trier of fact must accept unrebutted testimony); Franciscan Communities, Inc. v.

Putting aside the fact that the court was not required to give equal weight to the statutory factors (In re Marriage of Stam, 260 Ill. App. 3d 754, 756 (1994)), nothing indicated that the court failed to consider them. For instance, although the court mentioned that petitioner already needed a wheelchair when she married respondent, we view the comment as the acknowledgement that the wheelchair did not prevent her from working, as petitioner testified that she and respondent discussed whether she would work after the parties married.

For the same reasons, we conclude that the court did not overlook the parties\u2019 allegedly disparate financial circumstances. The court noted that respondent\u2019s gross monthly income exceeded petitioner\u2019s. However, it found that the difference did not warrant awarding petitioner permanent maintenance, as, among other things, petitioner\u2019s assets far exceeded respondent\u2019s, and petitioner\u2019s assessment of her finances was suspect given her inflated expenses and the questionable source of some of her income. \u00b6 25 When we consider the entirety of the trial court\u2019s decision, we conclude that the court did not improperly weigh the evidence in balancing all the relevant factors.

Id. n.1. Pal had notice of the consequences when she signed her asylum application beneath a bold-print warning of the consequences of filing a frivolous application and when she affirmed that she was aware of those consequences at her asylum interview. See Cheema v. Holder, 693 F.3d 1045, 1049 (9th Cir. 2012); see also Kulakchyan, 730 F.3d at 995. The BIA\u2019s specific finding that Pal filed a frivolous application is supported by substantial evidence, including the fact that Pal renewed her fabricated application after she purportedly knew of its contents. See Ahir v. Mukasey, 527 F.3d 912, 918 (9th Cir. 2008).

After the collision, the driver of the Geo Prizm, later identified as Leonard, drove away from the scene. Lynn followed the vehicle and found the Geo Prizm abandoned on Fairview Avenue. Later that day, Lynn contacted the police about the incident. Corporal Andrew Hominsky went to Fairview Avenue to recover the damaged vehicle. Corporal Hominsky discovered that the damaged vehicle was the same vehicle that Kessler had reported stolen earlier that day to Officer Harvey. The damage to the vehicle was consistent with the details of the collision that Lynn had described. That evening, an employee of the Carnegie Free Library in Connellsville reported the presence of a suspicious person. Office Harvey and Lieutenant Tom Patton responded to the call and found Leonard asleep in the library\u2019s computer room with a variety of items surrounding him, including an Xbox One console, BB guns, and a book bag containing knives, controllers, and clothing. Officer Harvey took Leonard to the police station for questioning about the stolen vehicle.

The fact finder could have determined, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Leonard unlawfully possessed those items where the record shows Leonard was left unsupervised in the Travis house, the items were taken from an area Leonard was specifically prohibited from accessing, Leonard did not have permission to possess the items, and Leonard was found in possession of the items later that same day. Accordingly, this claim is meritless.

LAVON CALDWELL, Appellant On Appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (D.C. Criminal No. 4-18-cr-00041-001) District Judge: Honorable Matthew W. Brann Submitted Under Third Circuit L.A.R. 34.1(a) January 14, 2020 Before: JORDAN, GREENAWAY, JR., and KRAUSE, Circuit Judges. (Opinion Filed: February 10, 2020) ______________OPINION* GREENAWAY, JR., Circuit Judge. On May 8, 2019, following Appellant Lavon Caldwell\u2019s guilty plea for possession of a weapon while incarcerated, the District Court sentenced him to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. Caldwell appeals that sentence on the grounds that the District Court failed to consider and apply the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The record, however, shows the contrary, and we will affirm. I. BACKGROUND On March 7, 2017, correctional officers conducted a pat-down search of Caldwell. During that search, the officers found two wooden shanks of approximately six and seven inches long on Caldwell\u2019s person. A grand jury subsequently indicted Caldwell for possession of contraband in prison in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2). Caldwell pled guilty to that offense, and the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his guideline range as 18 to 24 months. PSR \u00b6 56. The District Court sentenced Caldwell to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, the",

At both stages we review for abuse of discretion. Negroni, 638 F.3d at 443. III. DISCUSSION Caldwell makes both a procedural and a substantive challenge to his sentence. First, he argues that his sentence is procedurally unsound because the District Court did not properly weigh all seven \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Second, he contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the sentence precludes him from earning credit towards service of his sentence. Neither argument is availing. As to Caldwell\u2019s procedural challenge, we read the record differently than he does. Contrary to Caldwell\u2019s argument, the District Court stated explicitly that it considered \u201call seven factors as set forth at Title 18 of the United States Code at Section 3553(a).\u201d App. 20. In fact, the District Court explained how the factors supported its ultimate 4decision to grant Caldwell\u2019s motion for a downward departure, noting his \u201crehabilitative efforts, his generally mild prison conduct, and the other Section 3553 factors that I have mentioned.\u201d App. 20. Although the District Court did not make findings as to each factor, the case law in this Circuit is clear that the District Court did not need to do so. See United States v. Handerhan, 739 F.3d 114, 122\u201324 (3d Cir. 2014) (finding that the District Court did not commit procedural error in sentencing despite not discussing",

Accordingly, we find Caldwell\u2019s procedural challenge unconvincing. As to Caldwell\u2019s substantive challenge, we disagree that a sentence of 12 months is unreasonable in comparison to a sentence of 10 months, which he effectively would have served, assuming good behavior, had he been sentenced to 12 months and a day. The only circumstance under which we would vacate a sentence for substantive reasons is if \u201cno reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.\u201d United States v. Wright, 642 F.3d 148, 152 (3d Cir. 2011). Here, the sentence imposed by the District Court is entirely reasonable, and we find no basis to disturb it. This sentence does not amount to an abuse of discretion. The substantive challenge is therefore without merit. IV. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of conviction imposed by the District Court.",

BEFORE: MCCLENDON, WELCH, AND HOLDRIDGE, JJ. WRIT DENIED. The sentencing transcript clearly shows that the district court did not impose a sentence on the second degree battery conviction ( count 2) prior to the habitual offender proceedings. Thus, there was no original sentence to vacate. Further, the habitual offender sentence imposed for count 2 did not restrict parole. Parole was only restricted with respect to defendant' s ten --year sentence on count 3 for domestic abuse battery by burning. Pursuant to La. R. S. 14: 35. 3( M), the district court was authorized to restrict parole for the domestic abuse battery by burning conviction, and the court informed relator of the penalties for all of the offenses prior to accepting his guilty pleas. Furthermore, the district court did not impose an additional sentence for relator' s prior conviction in docket number 551801. Accordingly, none of the claims presented by relator in the writ application have merit. Therefore, the district court did not err by denying the motion to correct an illegal sentence.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND S.P. took her eight-year-old granddaughter, L.K., to lunch at a local fast food restaurant. They sat at a round booth; L.K. was facing the windows while her grandmother sat facing her. Near the windows of the restaurant there were tables and chairs that were higher than the booths. S.P. said her granddaughter was often distracted during their lunch and she had to encourage her to eat. S.P. said L.K. was particularly distracted by the area behind her, where a man was seated near the window. This man was later identified as Howell. As S.P. left with L.K., the child told her that \u201c[Howell\u2019s] pee-pee was out of his pants.\u201d Shortly after returning home, L.K. drew a picture of what she saw. She later recreated a similar drawing for a detective. Surveillance video from the restaurant was given to the police and still images show Howell exposing his penis to L.K. The video also shows Howell repeatedly reach between his legs and manipulate his genitals while L.K. looks in his direction. A detective interviewed Howell who admitted he was at the restaurant, had seen L.K., but did not remember exposing himself. However, Howell did not deny exposing himself when pressed. The State charged Howell with sexual abuse of a minor by causing L.K. to witness him rubbing his genitals. At trial, the surveillance video was admitted and L.K. testified. When asked if she witnessed Howell \u201chold\u201d or \u201ctouch\u201d his penis she responded \u201cNo.\u201d1 Howell moved for acquittal after the State\u2019s case-in-chief.2 He argued the evidence only showed he had exposed himself to L.K. and, based on her testimony, she had not witnessed an act of sexual conduct that is required for conviction under the statute. The State responded there was \u201cmore than enough evidence to show that while [L.K.] was present and while she was looking at [Howell], he had his hand down in the area of his exposed penis [and] he was moving it up and down.\u201d The district court denied the motion. The jury was given instructions which incorporated the lesser included offense of indecent exposure. After trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict of felony sexual abuse of a child 1 Q: Did you ever see [Howell] hold his penis? A: No. Q: Did you ever see [Howell] touch his penis?

GRATTON, Judge The State appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment reducing Tyler Anthony Howell\u2019s conviction for felony sexual abuse of a child under the age of sixteen years, Idaho Code \u00a7 181506, to a conviction of misdemeanor indecent exposure, I.C. \u00a7 18-4116.

For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the district court\u2019s order, vacate the judgment, reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict, and remand for sentencing on the crime of conviction. 1I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND S.P. took her eight-year-old granddaughter, L.K., to lunch at a local fast food restaurant. They sat at a round booth; L.K. was facing the windows while her grandmother sat facing her. Near the windows of the restaurant there were tables and chairs that were higher than the booths. S.P. said her granddaughter was often distracted during their lunch and she had to encourage her to eat. S.P. said L.K. was particularly distracted by the area behind her, where a man was seated near the window. This man was later identified as Howell. As S.P. left with L.K., the child told her that \u201c[Howell\u2019s] pee-pee was out of his pants.\u201d Shortly after returning home, L.K. drew a picture of what she saw. She later recreated a similar drawing for a detective. Surveillance video from the restaurant was given to the police and still images show Howell exposing his penis to L.K. The video also shows Howell repeatedly reach between his legs and manipulate his genitals while L.K. looks in his direction. A detective interviewed Howell who admitted he was at the restaurant, had seen L.K., but did not remember exposing himself. However, Howell did not deny exposing himself when pressed. The State charged Howell with sexual abuse of a minor by causing L.K. to witness him rubbing his genitals. At trial, the surveillance video was admitted and L.K. testified. When asked if she witnessed Howell \u201chold\u201d or \u201ctouch\u201d his penis she responded \u201cNo.\u201d1 Howell moved for acquittal after the State\u2019s case-in-chief.2 He argued the evidence only showed he had exposed himself to L.K. and, based on her testimony, she had not witnessed an act of sexual conduct that is required for conviction under the statute. The State responded there was \u201cmore than enough evidence to show that while [L.K.] was present and while she was looking at [Howell], he had his hand down in the area of his exposed penis [and] he was moving it up and down.\u201d The district court denied the motion.

Specifically, it argues the evidence sufficiently demonstrated an act of sexual conduct which is required to prove felony child abuse. I.C. \u00a7 18-1506. It asserts the district court incorrectly determined the victim\u2019s testimony contradicted the video because it is reasonable to believe the child witnessed sexual conduct, but because of her young age could not understand 3 I.C.R. 29(c). 3the concept. We conclude a reasonable jury could have determined that guilt had been proven as to each element, including sexual conduct. Idaho Code \u00a7 18-1506(1)(d) states it is a felony for a person to induce, cause, or permit a minor child to witness an act of sexual conduct. Sexual conduct means human masturbation or any touching of the genitals or pubic areas. I.C. \u00a7 18-1506(4). When Howell motioned the district court for judgment of acquittal, the district court was tasked with assessing whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction to support the verdict. Evidence is sufficient if there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the prosecution sustained its burden of proving the essential elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

L.K. confirmed she saw Howell\u2019s genitals but denied having seen him touch or rub the area. She also denied seeing him open and close his legs in order to hide his genitals from other customers in the restaurant but when pressed clarified that she did not remember. Deputy Kelch testified to what he observed, which he believed to be sexual conduct on the surveillance video: So initially as he pulled [his penis] out--or kind of rubbed up on it, up and down, and then as he sat there, he would open his legs when the little girl was in direct view throughout the time as she ate. She was interacting with other kids in the restaurant, talking to her grandmother. So the opening of the legs happened only when she was kinda looking in his direction. . . . . [W]hile she\u2019s [at the restaurant] you can see him repeatedly going down into his groin area and then opening the legs multiple times. Detective Strolberg also testified to what she believed to be a connection between the sexual conduct and L.K.\u2019s attention: Q: Specifically, what was it that you noticed? A: When [Howell] had her attention and no one else was viewing him, he had his legs spread apart with his penis showing. . . . . Q: Okay.

The video is in evidence and the jury will be making its own conclusions about what it sees.\u201d The jury did just that, returning a guilty verdict.4 The district court, however, determined the evidence was not sufficient to demonstrate L.K. had witnessed sexual conduct, and stated: It\u2019s just that this evidence does not support that offense in 100 percent; [it] supports [the] included offense of indecent exposure. . . . .

The child did not see that and she was really clear that she did not see that. She saw him expose himself.

Rios, 2011 IL App (4th) 100461, 960 N.E.2d 70, the defendant contended the trial court improperly considered a factor in aggravation which was inherent in the offense by commenting on the amount of money a defendant, convicted of possession with intent to deliver, was making a day, - 14 -the number of people being supplied, and the lack of financial need to sell drugs. We found comments by the court intended to highlight the \u201cextent and nature of a defendant\u2019s involvement in a particular criminal enterprise, a defendant\u2019s underlying motivation for committing the offense, the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s commission of similar offenses in the future and the need to deter others from committing similar crimes\u201d are proper considerations.

Considering the evidence of the quantity of plants and the \u201celaborate\u201d growing methods, when coupled with defendant\u2019s own statements, it was not unreasonable for the trial court to consider the very real possibility the production of such a quantity of cannabis plants was, at least in part, intended for sale.

Vermeerremoved the case and the district court1 denied Ellingsworth\u2019s motions to remand and for leave to amend and granted summary judgment to Vermeer. We affirm each of those rulings. I. Ellingsworth, an employee of Vaught Tree Service, was injured on the job in February 2014. He was feeding a small tree into a Vermeer-manufactured wood chipper using a winch attached to the chipper when the winch line became entangled in the tree\u2019s branches. The line was drawn into the chipper and then shot back out, seriously injuring Ellingsworth\u2019s legs. Ellingsworth filed this action in Missouri state court. As relevant here, he alleged products liability and failure to warn claims under both strict liability and negligence theories. He also brought claims against his supervisor at Vaught, Dwayne Marshall, alleging Marshall increased the danger posed by the wood chipper on the job site.

Co., 694 F.3d 935, 948 (8th Cir. 2012). -4-As the district court explained in denying his motion, at the time that Ellingsworth sought leave to amend, no new facts supporting an agency liability claim against Vermeer had come to light. On top of that, the litigation was at an advanced stage and granting the motion would have required reopening discovery. Ellingsworth admits that his real reason for pressing the agency claim belatedly was his realization that he had no other way to hold Vermeer Oklahoma liable for allegedly building and installing the winch. His attempted addition of the claim had more to do with a change in litigation strategy than in the factual or legal basis of his case. That is not sufficient to establish good cause and the district court was well within its discretion to deny the motion. IV. Finally, Ellingsworth claims that the district court erred in granting Vermeer\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his products liability and failure to warn claims. We review a grant of summary judgment de novo and will affirm if the record shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and the prevailing party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

On appeal, Ellingsworth makes clear that his remaining claims against Vermeer for both products liability and failure to warn only concern the winch attachment to the wood chipper, not the wood chipper itself. Under Missouri law, both strict liability and negligence versions of these claims require that the defendant manufactured or sold the product causing injury. Johnson v. Auto Handling Corp., 523 S.W.3d 452, 466 (Mo. banc 2017) (negligent products liability and failure to warn); Moore v. Ford Motor Co., 332 S.W.3d 749, 756 (Mo. banc 2011) (strict liability failure to warn); Strong v. Am. Cyanamid Co., 261 S.W.3d 493, 506 (Mo. Ct. App. 2007), overruled on other grounds by Badahman v. Catering St. Louis, 395 S.W.3d 29, 40 (Mo. banc 2013) (strict liability products liability). That element is fatal to Ellingsworth\u2019s case. -5-The record shows that Vermeer did not manufacture the winch attachment that injured Ellingsworth. It is uncontested that Vermeer offers no after-market winch attachments for sale and that the wood chipper that injured Ellingsworth did not have a winch when Vermeer manufactured it. At most, the evidence suggests that the winch was constructed by a third party out of mostly Vermeer parts, but Ellingsworth\u2019s suit is not about the quality of the winch parts. He alleges that Vermeer manufactured the winch itself. Because the record forecloses that argument, the district court correctly granted Vermeer summary judgment. We affirm. -6-",

For the reasons that follow, we will summarily affirm. In 2009, Holloway pled guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced to fifteen years in prison, having been designated as an armed career criminal based on three previous felony convictions for serious drug offenses. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed on direct appeal. United States v. Holloway, 431 F. App\u2019x 233 (4th Cir. 2011).

Both \u00a7 2255 motions were denied; the first as untimely and the second as an unauthorized successive motion that was nonetheless meritless. The Fourth Circuit also denied his application for authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion.

The State has moved to affirm the judgment below on the ground that it is manifest on the face of Brown\u2019s opening brief that his appeal is without merit. We agree and affirm.

As part of the plea agreement, (i) the State nolle prosequied the remaining nine charges against Brown, (ii) the parties asked for immediate sentencing, (iii) the parties requested that the minimum mandatory sentence of three years of Level V incarceration be imposed, and (iv) Brown admitted that he was an habitual offender as defined by \u00a7 4214(a).

Although it is unclear whether he believes the court should have held a separate hearing in 2006 or 2013, it is clear that Brown has long since waived any challenge he could have raised with respect to his completed 2006 sentence. As for Brown\u2019s 2013 sentence, Brown raised no objection to the Superior Court sentencing him on the same day it considered the State\u2019s habitual offender motion, nor did he file a timely motion for the correction of a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within ninety days of the imposition of the sentence.11 Accordingly, Brown may not object to court\u2019s failure to hold a separate hearing on the State\u2019s motion to declare him an habitual offender now.

Richard Goodface appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his application for a writ of habeas corpus. Goodface is serving two concurrent sentences: a 28-month federal term of imprisonment for possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and the remainder of a five-year state parole revocation sentence.

This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

I Goodface was convicted in Colorado state court of attempted first-degree murder and sentenced to a twenty-year prison term, to be followed by a mandatory five-year term of parole. On March 22, 2016, he was released from prison and began serving his state parole term. On June 24, 2016, he was arrested for violating his parole conditions. He was held in county jail and charged with state offenses. On August 24, 2016, he was indicted on a federal charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The state offenses, which were based on the same conduct as the federal charge, were later dismissed. On August 30, 2016, Goodface was transferred to the custody of the United States Marshals Service (\u201cUSMS\u201d) pursuant to a federal writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum.

The time Goodface spent in official detention was credited against his state sentence. That is all the statute\u2019s plain language requires. Goodface also notes that \u00a7 3585(b) makes no reference to credit granted toward a term of parole. But under Colorado law, \u201cthe term \u2018sentence\u2019 incorporates both the incarceration component and the mandatory parole component of an offender\u2019s penalty.\u201d People v. Norton, 63 P.3d 339, 344 (Colo. 2003). Goodface does not contest this principle of Colorado law. Although \u00a7 3585(b) does refer to credit for time spent in official detention, nothing in the statute requires the BOP to ignore a state\u2019s grant of credit against a parole sentence. The statute does not require a court to inquire into why the credit was given, or under what other circumstances such credit might have been given. This interpretation is consistent with the statutory purpose of the exclusion, which is 5to prevent a defendant from receiving \u201ca double credit for his detention time.\u201d Wilson, 503 U.S. at 337. In this case, the BOP did just that: consistent with \u00a7 3585(b), it denied Goodface credit against his federal sentence for the time he spent in USMS custody because Colorado had already credited that time against his state parole sentence.

Judgment of conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm, affirmed. Eric D. Fredericksen, State Appellate Public Defender; Brian R. Dickson, Deputy Appellate Public Defender, Boise, for appellant. Hon. Lawrence G. Wasden, Attorney General; Ted S. Tollefson, Deputy Attorney General, Boise, for respondent. LORELLO, Judge David J. Whitecotton appeals from his judgment of conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm. Whitecotton argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress and that the district court abused its discretion at sentencing. We affirm. I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND One afternoon, a citizen observed a man pacing outside a local pharmacy. After entering the pharmacy to fill a prescription, the citizen watched the man enter and inquire about maps. The citizen then left the pharmacy to meet a family member at the neighboring supermarket. Upon leaving the supermarket, the citizen and her brother struck up a conversation with some friends they encountered in the parking lot. The man then approached the group and injected 1himself into their conversation and introduced himself as Whitecotton. Whitecotton then lingered with the group and kept turning his body toward them to display his holstered firearm. After a few minutes, the conversation ended and the citizen left. The citizen found Whitecotton\u2019s behavior so strange and suspicious that she went to the police department with her brother and reported him. In response to the citizen\u2019s report, an officer was dispatched to the pharmacy. The officer observed a vehicle with Oregon license plates matching the one reportedly associated with Whitecotton.

Perez-Jungo, 156 Idaho at 616, 329 P.3d at 398. 5 Contrary to Whitecotton\u2019s claim, the citizen\u2019s concern was not that Whitecotton was \u201changing around a public place with a firearm,\u201d it was his behavior coupled with the fact that he was armed. The State highlighted this point in its response to Whitecotton\u2019s motion: \u201cAs noted in her statement, [the citizen\u2019s] concern was directed at Whitecotton\u2019s behavior with the firearm, not the mere",

First, the assessment must be based upon all the circumstances.

From these data, a trained officer draws inferences and makes deductions--inferences and deductions that might well elude an untrained person. The process does not deal with hard certainties, but with probabilities. Long before the law of probabilities was articulated as such, practical people formulated certain common sense conclusions about human behavior; jurors as factfinders are permitted to do the same--and so are law enforcement officers.

The officer made contact with Whitecotton because a concerned citizen went to the police department to report \u201csuspicious\u201d behavior.7 The officer described the report as follows: 7 The reporting citizen also provided a written statement after Whitecotton\u2019s arrest. The statement indicates that the incident occurred at 3:30 p.m. and reads as follows: I went into [a local pharmacy] and noticed a man pacing out front after I picked up my prescription he was inside asking about maps. I left and went into [a supermarket] to meet with my brother when we went outside we ran into my other brother and a few friends and we were talking. A few minutes into the conversation the same man walked up to us and shook my brother[\u2019]s hand and introduced himself by first name. [H]e had a holstered gun on his side and he kept turning that side towards us which I thought was odd, he stood there while we continued talking for a few minutes which again I thought was odd so when I left I went to the P.D.",

Mich. 2014) (noting \u201clong-recognized concerns for the safety of police officers and the public have taken on even greater urgency by recurrent tragedies triggered by gun violence in public spaces\u201d and concluding that \u201c[t]o prevent such tragedies, police are properly given sufficient freedom of action to investigate circumstances that reasonably suggest an immediate risk to officer or public safety\u201d). As explained in Terry, reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment requires balancing the need for the seizure against the invasion the seizure entails. Terry, 392 U.S. at 21. The balance in this case supports the conclusion that no Fourth Amendment violation occurred. A limited seizure to investigate and identify an armed individual acting suspiciously by pacing and lingering in front of a business who at the same time is behaving abnormally by interjecting himself into the conversation of strangers and accentuating the presence of his holstered firearm does not offend the Fourth Amendment. The district court did not err in denying Whitecotton\u2019s motion to suppress. 10B. Sentencing Whitecotton next argues the district court abused its discretion when sentencing him.",

Specifically, Whitecotton argues, based upon a single statement by the district court during a hearing on a motion seeking a sentence reduction, that the district court failed to act according to applicable legal standards because it considered the fact that Whitecotton exercised his constitutional right to a jury trial. The State responds that, when taken in context, the district court\u2019s allegedly improper statement does not indicate that Whitecotton was being punished for exercising a constitutional right. The State further argues that, even if the district court improperly considered Whitecotton\u2019s demand for a jury trial, the district court did not abuse its discretion because Whitecotton\u2019s sentence is supported by other proper rationales. It is improper for a court to penalize a defendant merely because he or she exercises the right to put the government to its proof at trial. State v. Kellis, 148 Idaho 812, 814, 229 P.3d 1174, 1176 (Ct. App. 2010). We will not, however, vacate a sentence whenever a comment by a district court implies a defendant is being punished for exercising his or her right to plead not guilty. State v.

This Court\u2019s jurisdiction over district court orders remanding removed cases to state court is constrained by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which states that an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is generally not reviewable on appeal. However, \u00a7 1447(d) allows for appellate review of cases that were properly removed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443.

Chochaev previously petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s order affirming the denial of his motion to reopen his removal order; a panel of this Court dismissed that petition in part and denied it in part. See Chochaev v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 783 F. App\u2019x 967, 968 (11th Cir. 2019). Chochaev\u2019s present petition raises four arguments. First, he asserts that the BIA erred by rejecting his argument that his serious illness and his prior attorneys\u2019 ineffective assistance amounted to exceptional circumstances that excused his failure to appear at his removal hearing, rendering his in absentia order of removal inappropriate. Second, he contends that the BIA erred by ignoring In re Velarde-Pacheco, 23 I. & N. Dec. 253 (B.I.A. 2002), overruled on other grounds by Matter of Avetisyan, 25 I. & N. Dec. 688 (B.I.A. 2012), in its decision declining to reopen his proceedings based on his marriage to a lawful permanent resident (LPR) and his pending visa petition. Third, he argues that the BIA erred in declining to exercise its sua sponte authority to reopen his case. Finally, Chochaev",

However, pursuant to the \u201cbona fide marriage exception,\u201d this bar to adjustment of status\u2014 shall not apply with respect to a marriage if the alien establishes by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that the marriage was entered into in good faith and in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place and the marriage was not entered into",

In The Fourteenth Court of Appeals NO. 14-19-00349-CR EX PARTE JAMES NORMAN FRYBERGER On Appeal from the 10th District Court Galveston County, Texas Trial Court Cause No. 19CR0839 MEMORANDUM OPINION Appellant appeals the trial court\u2019s order denying his application for writ of habeas corpus. Appellant\u2019s appointed counsel filed a brief in which he concludes the appeal is wholly frivolous and without merit. The brief meets the requirements of Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), by presenting a professional evaluation of the record and demonstrating why there are no arguable grounds to be advanced. See High v. State, 573 S.W.2d 807, 811\u201313 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978). A copy of counsel\u2019s brief was delivered to appellant. Appellant was advised of the right to examine the appellate record and file a pro se response. See Staffordv. State, 813 S.W.2d 503, 512 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991). As of this date, more than 60 days have passed and no pro se response has been filed. We have carefully reviewed the record and counsel\u2019s brief and agree the appeal is wholly frivolous and without merit. Further, we find no reversible error in the record. We are not to address the merits of each claim raised in an Anders brief or a pro se response when we have determined there are no arguable grounds for review. See Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 827\u201328 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005). Accordingly, the order of the trial court is affirmed. PER CURIAM",

Mackovski admits that there is no case directly on point establishing that the force Officer Bex used was unreasonable. Plaintiffs do not need case law that is exactly on point, but existing precedent must place the contours of the right \u201cbeyond debate.\u201d White v. Pauly, 137 S. Ct. 548, 551 (2017) (quoting Mullenix v. Luna, 136 S. Ct. 305, 308 (2015)). Mackovski relies on Smith v. City of Hemet, 394 F.3d 689 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc) and Curnow ex rel. Curnow v. Ridgecrest Police, 952 F.2d 321 (9th Cir. 1991), but neither are sufficient to support his burden. Therefore, Officer Bex is entitled to qualified immunity. 2The law of the case doctrine does not apply to Mackovski\u2019s current appeal because the prior panel did not consider qualified immunity.

In September 2017, defendant, Gary A. O\u2019Bryant, filed a motion for revocation of fines pursuant to section 5-9-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections (Code) (730 ILCS 5/5-9-2 (West 2016)), asserting he had no means to pay his fines while incarcerated and would be unable to find employment after his projected release from custody. The trial court issued an order denying his section 5-9-2 motion, and defendant appealed. \u00b6 3 In September 2019, OSAD filed a motion to withdraw. In its brief, OSAD contends that appeal of this case would be without arguable merit. We agree, grant OSAD\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel, and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment. \u00b6 4 I. BACKGROUND\u00b6 5 A.

In exchange for defendant\u2019s pleading guilty, the State (1) dismissed counts I and II and (2) agreed to cap",

PER CURIAM. Kyle T. Wade pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). After determining that Wade qualified for sentencing under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), the district court sentenced Wade to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Wade appeals, contending the district court violated the SixthAmendment when it found, for ACCA purposes, that Wade had committed two previous offenses charged in a single indictment on occasions different from one another. Wade claims that under the Sixth Amendment this was a fact for a jury to find. Because this argument is foreclosed by our precedent, we affirm. On October 2, 2018, Wade pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm. The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) indicated that because Wade had three previous drug-related convictions, he qualified for a sentencing enhancement under ACCA. One conviction was for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, in violation of Missouri law. The other two were federal convictions for distribution of",

The federal charges were brought in the same indictment, which, along with the plea agreement in that case, made clear that Wade had engaged in the conduct underlying one of the charges on February 24, 2012, and the conduct underlying the other charge on October 5, 2012. The district court rejected Wade\u2019s argument that his Missouri state conviction did not count as a serious drug offense under ACCA. Wade asserts a new argument on appeal. He claims the district court violated the Sixth Amendment when it, instead of a jury, decided the question of whether the conduct underlying Wade\u2019s two federal drug offenses took place on different occasions. Wade\u2019s claim is foreclosed by our precedent. United States v. Harris, 794 F.3d 885, 887 (8th Cir. 2015).

Butler to file appellant\u2019s brief no later than February 25, 2020. If the brief is not filed by that date, counsel may be required to show cause why he should not be held in contempt of court. It is ordered on February 11, 2020. Before Justices Goodwin, Kelly, and Smith",

The trial court stated on the record that an aggravated-range sentence on the involuntary manslaughter count was justified because Mulkin delivered drugs he knew to have recently caused others to overdose,8 and because Mulkin had previously been caught with controlled substances while incarcerated for drug possession. 5 Furanylfentanyl is a derivative of the synthetic opioid, Fentanyl. N.T. Trial, 6/20/19, at 200-23. Fentanyl is 80 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and furanylfentanyl is slightly less potent than Fentanyl.

In a supplemental Rule 1925(a) opinion, the sentencing judge noted: Right before sentencing, the Commonwealth filed for a large amount of costs and restitution and furnished a large packet of documents relating to those claims. Much of the amount claimed related to expert witness costs and fees. The [c]ourt erroneously, and without objection from either party, decided to set a separate restitution hearing[10] due to the complexity and amount of restitution claimed and inability of the defense to then evaluate and contest the amounts claimed.

PER CURIAM: Russell Todd Mathis was convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and aiding and abetting the possession with the intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A)(viii). He was sentenced to life in prison and now appeals his convictions and sentence. With respect to his convictions, he argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. With respect to his sentence, he argues that the district court erred in considering acquitted conduct during sentencing, or alternatively, that the district court erred by concluding that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that he possessed a dangerous weapon for purposes of an enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1). We reject his arguments and affirm. I We review de novo the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency grounds. United States v. Browne, 505 F.3d 1229, 1253 (11th Cir. 2007). We view the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the Government, drawing all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in the Government\u2019s favor.\u201d Id.

Silvestri, 409 F.3d 1311, 1328 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, the government presented ample evidence for a reasonable jury to convict Mathis of conspiracy. Walter Williams testified that Mathis routinely purchased methamphetamine from him in increasingly large quantities. This was corroborated by evidence\u2014from a roving wiretap targeting Williams\u2014of numerous texts and calls indicating drug transactions between Williams and Mathis. Williams testified that when Mathis got in trouble and was required to wear an ankle monitor, he would send his girlfriend, Elizabeth Gallaher, to pick up the drugs. Moreover, Dana Stokes and Ashley Shaw both testified that Mathis purchased large quantities of methamphetamine from Williams and worked with others to distribute it. Williams, Shaw, and Stokes, each identified purchases or sales of methamphetamines by Mathis that jury could reasonably conclude amounted to participation or facilitation of the conspiracy. Additionally, three large quantities of methamphetamine seized in the course of the investigation had a nexus to Mathis. First, a significant quantity of methamphetamine and a firearm were found in the car of Elizabeth Gallaher, with text messages from the wiretap and phone call recordings from the jail",

III We also reject the challenge to Mathis\u2019s sentence. Mathis argues that the district court improperly considered acquitted conduct when it found, for sentencing purposes, that he possessed a firearm. He makes two alternative arguments on this point. First, he argues that because the jury acquitted him of the possession of a firearm and the related drug offense, the district court improperly considered the firearm at sentencing. Second, he argues\u2014in a single sentence with no elaboration\u2014that the \u201ctrial court erred in finding, by preponderance of the evidence, that Mr. Mathis possessed a firearm.\u201d We can reject his first argument based on clear precedent. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that the sentencing court may consider any fact for which a defendant has been acquitted as long as the Government proves, by a preponderance of the evidence, the occurrence of that conduct and as long as the enhancement results in a sentence below the maximum statutory penalty authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Maddox, 803 F.3d at 1220.

We affirm. I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND Doe is the mother of a child born in 2011. The child was placed in shelter care after police received a report of parental substance abuse and the child being left without a caregiver. The magistrate court awarded legal custody of the child to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and approved a case plan for Doe in November 2017. The child was placed with Doe\u2019s 1brother and his wife. In March 2018, Doe\u2019s brother and his wife moved to New York and the magistrate court approved an out-of-state placement with them.

Following trial, the magistrate court terminated Doe\u2019s parental rights after finding clear and convincing evidence that Doe had neglected the child and termination is in the child\u2019s best interests. Doe appeals. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW On appeal from a decision terminating parental rights, this Court examines whether the decision is supported by substantial and competent evidence, which means such evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Doe v. Doe, 148 Idaho 243, 245-46, 220 P.3d 1062, 1064-65 (2009). The appellate court will indulge all reasonable inferences in support of the trial court\u2019s judgment when reviewing an order that parental rights be terminated. Id. The Idaho Supreme Court has also said that the substantial evidence test requires a greater quantum of evidence in cases where the trial court\u2019s finding must be supported by clear and convincing evidence than in cases where a mere preponderance is required. Doe v. Doe, 143 Idaho 343, 346, 144 P.3d 597, 600 (2006). Clear and convincing evidence is generally understood to be evidence indicating that the thing to be proved is highly probable or reasonably certain. In re Doe, 143 Idaho 188, 191, 141 P.3d 1057, 1060 (2006). Further, the trial court\u2019s decision must be supported by objectively supportable grounds. Doe, 143 Idaho at 346, 144",

    "content": "Doe raises two issues on appeal. First, Doe contends that it was impossible for her to complete her case plan due to the child\u2019s removal from the state and placement in New York. Second, Doe contends that the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts should be examined on appeal, and the lack of reasonable efforts should be a defense to termination notwithstanding the absence of such a requirement in the statute governing termination. We affirm the decision of the magistrate court terminating Doe\u2019s parental rights. 2A. Reviewability of Reasonable Efforts We first address Doe\u2019s arguments regarding the reviewability of the Department\u2019s reasonable efforts at reunification. Doe contends that, in Idaho, termination of parental rights may occur even if the Department has made no reasonable efforts at reunification. Doe argues this alleged defect potentially jeopardizes federal funding for Idaho\u2019s foster care system. Finally, Doe asserts \u201cthere is no way to review\u201d a finding that the Department has made reasonable efforts other than on a \u201climited basis\u201d during the child protection case. Doe argues that due process requires \u201cmore.\u201d We disagree. Doe\u2019s contention that parental rights may be terminated without any reasonable efforts is not supported by law. The Child Protective Act requires reasonable efforts. A petition for removal from the home must state that reasonable efforts were made to prevent removal from the home or that reasonable efforts to prevent placement were not required due to",

Finally, the magistrate court found that, other than sending the child a box of toys, Doe did not provide consistent support for the child while she was in foster care. Doe asserts that the magistrate court erred in finding that she neglected the child by failing to complete the case plan because it was impossible for her to complete two of the tasks in the case plan once the child was placed out of state. Specifically, Doe argues that her efforts to accomplish two \u201cimportant tasks\u201d in her case plan \u201cwere utterly frustrated\u201d when the child was moved out of state. The two tasks Doe identifies as impossible to complete are Task 1.1.1.5 (which required her to participate in regular visits with the child in order to create healthy attachments and implement proper parenting techniques) and Task 1.1.1.6 (which required Doe to demonstrate an ability to provide for the child\u2019s basic developmental, medical, and other needs). However, the magistrate court found that, while moving the child out of state presented difficulties, those difficulties were not insurmountable. With respect to visitation, the evidence presented at trial showed that the Department attempted to assist with visitation by referring Doe to an independent service provider so that visits could take place through an independent party.

The district court1 found that he was a career offender, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and 1The Honorable Linda R.

On appeal, he challenges the court\u2019s application of the career-offender Guideline and its authority to sentence him consecutively. We affirm. I. Snow\u2019s first argument focuses on the overlapping effects of a 2005 Iowa drug conviction. This conviction factored into his federal sentence in two ways. First, it increased the statutory maximum for his crime from 40 years to life in prison. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851. Second, it made Snow a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a) (discussing \u201ccontrolled substance offense[s]\u201d).

Snow argues that using a single conviction for these two purposes was impermissible \u201cdouble counting\u201d that led to a miscalculated Guidelines range. He did not make this argument before the district court, so our review is for plain error. See United States v. Lovato, 868 F.3d 681, 684 (8th Cir. 2017). For two reasons, there was no plain error here. First, the district court applied the statute and the career-offender Guideline the right way. The two work in tandem with one another. Prior convictions are initially used to determine whether any statutory enhancements apply. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2; see also United States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 758\u201359 (1997). Then, depending on the applicable statutory maximum, the career-offender Guideline kicks in to reveal an offender\u2019s base offense level. Compare U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(1) (applying an offense level of 37 when the statutory maximum is \u201c[l]ife\u201d), with id. \u00a7 4B1.1(b)(2) (applying an offense level of 34 when the statutory maximum is \u201c25 years or more\u201d). The point is that, far from prohibiting a single conviction from \u201ccounting\u201d in both calculations, the text of the careeroffender Guideline all but says that it does. See id. \u00a7 4B1.1 cmt. n.2. Second, to the extent Snow\u2019s argument is independent of the text of these provisions, our decision in United States v.

It is true that revocation proceedings had already begun in Setser by the time the district court decided to order consecutive sentences. Id. at 233. Still, we do not believe this distinction matters. After all, the dividing line, according to the Supreme Court, is whether a state sentence is \u201canticipate[d],\u201d not whether formal proceedings have started. Id. at 236. In this case, the district court anticipated that Iowa would seek a prison sentence. It knew that Snow was on parole for prior drug crimes, identified the relevant Iowa cases by docket number, and familiarized itself with his criminal history and the facts underlying his most recent drug offense. It was no stretch to conclude that Snow\u2019s commission of another serious drug crime while on parole would conceivably lead to more prison time in Iowa. See Iowa Code \u00a7 908.5(1); see also Rhiner v. State, 703 N.W.2d 174, 177 (Iowa 2005) (describing Iowa\u2019s parolerevocation procedures); Iowa Admin. Code r. 201-45.2(1) (requiring, as a standard condition of parole, that a parolee \u201cobey all laws and ordinances\u201d). These facts place this case squarely within Setser\u2019s domain. III. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the district court. - 4 -",

[Appellant] contends it has no duty to defend or indemnify Milano in that lawsuit because, according to [appellant], the commercial general liability policy [] and the umbrella policy [] issued by [appellant] to Milano contain exclusions related to automobile accidents. [The trial] court granted [appellant] judgment on the pleadings with respect to the [commercial general liability policy] but denied judgment as to the [umbrella policy].

Trial court opinion, 12/21/18 at 2-3. Appellant filed a complaint on March 2, 2018, seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no duty to defend or indemnify Milano in the underlying lawsuit filed by Tait. On May 30, 2018, appellant filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court granted in part and denied in part on October 15, 2018.

Fitness Finding \u00b6 23 In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the State has the burden of proving parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. In re Jordan V., 347 Ill. App. 3d 1057, 1067, 808 N.E.2d 596, 604 (2004). In making a determination, the court considers whether the parent\u2019s conduct falls within one or more of the unfitness grounds described in section 1(D) of the Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2016)). Evidence of unfitness based on any ground enumerated in section 1(D) of the Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1(D) (West 2016)) is enough to support a finding of unfitness. In re C.W., 199 Ill. 2d 198, 210, 766 N.E.2d 1105, 1113 (2002). - 4 -A reviewing court will not overturn the trial court\u2019s finding of unfitness unless it is against the manifest weight of the evidence.

The State of Texas Appellate case number: 01-19-00082-CR Trial court case number: 1550442 Trial court: 179th District Court of Harris County The complete record was filed in this appeal on March 13, 2019. The appellant filed a motion to substitute counsel on April 10, 2019, which this court granted the following day. Since then the appellant has filed three motions to extend the time to file his brief, each of which this court granted. The appellant\u2019s brief was due on July 11, 2019, but the appellant did not file a brief. On July 19, 2019, the clerk of this court notified the appellant\u2019s counsel, Norman J. Silverman, that a brief had not been timely filed and that if this court did not receive his brief within ten days of that notice, it might direct the trial court to conduct a hearing in accordance with Rule 38.8(b) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure. The appellant\u2019s counsel failed to respond and has not filed a brief on the appellant\u2019s behalf. This court therefore abates the appeal and remands the cause to the trial court to conduct a hearing at which a representative of the Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office and the appellant\u2019s counsel, Norman J. Silverman, shall be present. At the trial court\u2019s discretion, the appellant may be present for the hearing in person or, if incarcerated, he may participate in the hearing by closed-circuit video",

Based on this testimony, Nevarez argues A.N.\u2019s description that Nevarez touched \u201cthe top of my private\u201d does not mean Nevarez touched her \u201cprivate\u201d and that A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram resolves \u201cany ambiguity\u201d by showing that Nevarez only touched A.N.\u2019s \u201clower abdomen\u201d and not her \u201cupper external genitalia.\u201d The State argues that A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram shows Nevarez touched A.N.\u2019s \u201cmons pubis,\u201d which Nevarez concedes is part of the female genitalia. We agree with the State. The Idaho Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford v. State, 160 Idaho 586, 595, 377 P.3d 400, 409 (2016), is instructive. In Crawford, the State charged Crawford with lewd conduct with a minor under sixteen, alleging manual-to-genital contact. Id. at 589, 377 P.3d at 403. At trial, the victim testified Crawford touched the \u201c[o]utside of [her] vaginal area.\u201d Id. at 590, 377 P.3d at 404. On appeal from the dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief, Crawford argued there was insufficient evident to support his conviction because the phrase \u201coutside of",

To the extent the phrase \u201cthe top of [her] private\u201d is ambiguous, the jury\u2019s province was to determine what A.N. meant by the phrase, and we will not substitute our view for that of the jury as to the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. See State v. Neyhart, 160 Idaho 746, 751, 378 P.3d 1045, 1050 (Ct. App. 2016) (ruling determining what victim meant by \u201cprivate\u201d was within jury\u2019s province). Moreover, A.N.\u2019s marking on the diagram of the unclothed girl does not support Nevarez\u2019s claim that he only \u201ctouched A.N.\u2019s lower abdomen.\u201d To the contrary, the marking tends to support the opposite, showing A.N. indicated Nevarez touched the mons pubis, which is part of the female external genitalia, as Nevarez concedes. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, there is substantial evidence upon which a reasonable trier of fact could have found the State sustained its burden beyond a reasonable doubt of proving manual-to-genital contact.

ORDER AND JUDGMENT* Before BACHARACH, SEYMOUR, and McHUGH, Circuit Judges. On February 24, 2014, Sophia Zayas pleaded guilty, through the Assimilated Crimes Act, to the New Mexico crime of child abuse resulting in great bodily harm. At the time of her guilty plea, the requisite mens rea under New Mexico law for child abuse resulting in great bodily harm was criminal negligence, a standard satisfied upon a showing that the defendant disregarded a risk of which she knew or should have known.

The government is not prejudiced by this clarification because the government interpreted Ms. Zayas\u2019s briefing as a challenge to the denial of her motion to withdraw the plea. 2I. BACKGROUND A. Factual History During the relevant time period, Ms. Zayas was a member of the Air Force living on Holloman Air Force base. On October 22, 2007, Ms. Zayas found her two-month-old daughter, Annalicia Zayas, unresponsive thirty minutes after putting Annalicia down for a nap. An autopsy showed Annalicia had suffered multiple skull fractures, hemorrhages, and scalp contusions within two to three hours of her death. The autopsy also revealed Annalicia had ten rib fractures in various stages of healing; healing fractures to her right wrist bones; and lesions on her body, consistent with cigarette burns, some of which were healing. The medical examiner ruled Annalicia\u2019s death a homicide. On April 24, 2012, a grand jury indicted Ms. Zayas, charging her with various violations of New Mexico law under the Assimilated Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7, 13.2 Ms. Zayas was arrested that same day.

We are not convinced. At the time Ms. Zayas pleaded guilty, her attorneys had no notice that the government would be required to prove recklessness instead of criminal negligence.

As the government conceded at oral argument, this language embodies a criminal negligence standard. There is no language in the Information that would have put Ms. Zayas on notice that the government would be required to prove recklessness\u2014that she consciously disregarded a known risk. Turning now to the plea agreement, we conclude it likewise fails to evidence Ms. Zayas\u2019s understanding that recklessness was required. Ms. Zayas admitted: I knew or should have known that my conduct created a substantial and foreseeable risk that my daughter, Annalicia Zayas, would be physically harmed or killed. I disregarded that risk, and I was wholly indifferent to the consequences of the conduct and to the welfare and safety of my daughter, Annalicia Zayas. ROA Vol. I at 175\u201376. The government emphasizes the second sentence\u2014that Ms. Zayas disregarded \u201cthat risk\u201d and was \u201cwholly indifferent to the consequences of the conduct.\u201d According to the government, this \u201cis the same language",

There is nothing in the Information or the plea agreement indicating the government would be required to prove that Ms. Zayas knew rather than should have known of the risk. In fact, at the time of Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea, the government would not have been required to prove more than criminal negligence. The use of \u201cshould have known\u201d in Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea agreement and the plea colloquy was not superfluous to the other reckless disregard language; it was an alternative basis for guilt. The should-have-known language in the plea agreement allowed the government to prove negligence when the defendant disregarded a risk of which she should have known. Later developments in New Mexico law make it clear that the should-have-known standard is no longer good law. And Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea colloquy emphatically confirms that she believed the government could prove its case because she should have known of the risk. In sum, the record reflects that Ms. Zayas was not aware of the specific requirements of the recklessness element\u2014that she consciously disregarded a known risk. There is nothing in the Information, plea agreement, or plea colloquy that would support the conclusion that Ms. Zayas received notice of the recklessness mens rea requirement from another source. Indeed, the Information that sets forth the",

Indeed, the Information that sets forth the criminal charge to which she pleaded guilty states only a negligence mens rea. Upon this 18record, we conclude Ms. Zayas\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because she was not informed of the elements of the offense to which she pleaded guilty. III. CONCLUSION Because there is no factual basis in the record to support the presumption that Ms. Zayas\u2019s attorneys explained the recklessness mens rea requirement to her, and there is no evidence in the record that she received notice of the recklessness mens rea requirement from any other source, Ms. Zayas\u2019s plea was not knowing and voluntary. Therefore, the district court abused its discretion in denying Ms. Zayas\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea.

A defendant must object both at trial and in a written posttrial motion to preserve for review. People v. Reese, 2017 IL 120011, \u00b6 60. Although Anderson objected to the admission of the statement before trial, he failed to object to the State\u2019s use of the statement in closing argument and did not challenge the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling or the State\u2019s closing argument in his posttrial motion. So, Anderson has forfeited review. \u00b6 24 Instead, Anderson asserts that his claim may be reviewed for plain error.

Anderson asserts that because the statement was not an excited utterance, it was only admissible to show that Anderson willfully ignored Adamidis\u2019s command, but the State used it to bolster the officers\u2019 testimony that Anderson drove the sedan. According to Anderson, the closeness of the evidence makes this highly prejudicial as evidenced by the jury sending the court two notes. But the statement not amounting to hearsay means that the prosecutor could refer to it in closing argument. See People v. Reed, 108 Ill.

(2:15-cr-00024-MSD-LRL-1; 2:17-cv-00584-MSD) Submitted: February 3, 2020 Decided: February 10, 2020 Before AGEE and KEENAN, Circuit Judges, and TRAXLER, Senior Circuit Judge. Dismissed by unpublished per curiam opinion. Ronald Laverne Johns, Jr., Appellant Pro Se. Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.PER CURIAM: Ronald Laverne Johns, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2018) motion. The order is not appealable unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B) (2018). A certificate of appealability will not issue absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2018). When the district court denies relief on the merits, a prisoner satisfies this standard by demonstrating that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong. See Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773-74 (2017). When the district court denies relief on procedural grounds, the prisoner must demonstrate both that the dispositive procedural ruling is debatable and that the",

For the reasons that follow, we will affirm. Desmond filed a notice of removal with the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking removal of one or more criminal actions from Delaware state court. After reviewing Desmond\u2019s removal petition, the District Court determined that it appeared Desmond was attempting to remove his case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 and the removal procedures set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455. The District Court then held that the allegations in Desmond\u2019s notice were insufficient to support removal under \u00a7 1443, denied the petition, and summarily remanded the case to the state court from which it was removed. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1455(b)(4) (\u201cIf it clearly appears on the face of the notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should not be permitted, the court shall make an order for summary remand.\u201d).

Desmond is neither a federal nor state officer. We further agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Desmond\u2019s reliance on Adams v. Governor of Delaware, 922 F.3d 166 (3d Cir. 2019), cert. granted, 2019 WL 6647103 (U.S. Dec. 6, 2019) (No. 19-309), is misplaced. In Adams, this Court held that sections of the Delaware Constitution that required the number of judges to be balanced between the two major political parties violated the First Amendment right to freedom of association. See id. at 184\u201385. Desmond appears to argue that this means he has been convicted in a proceeding presided over by a judge who had been unconstitutionally appointed. However, there is no language in Adams that implies that the judges previously appointed under Delaware\u2019s political balance requirement are unqualified to serve as judicial officers, nor did the Court give any indication that its decision was intended to support an argument that all prior Delaware convictions be vacated. Cf. Adams, 922 F.3d at 186 (McKee, J., concurring) (\u201cPraise for the Delaware judiciary is nearly universal, and it is well deserved.\u201d). As such, Desmond\u2019s Adams argument does not",

Claudia Yanira Magana, pro se. Daniel G. Kempland, Melissa D. Lang, and Gregory Michael Hahn, for respondent. SUMMARY OPINION GOEKE, Judge: This case was heard pursuant to the provisions of section 7463 of the Internal Revenue Code in effect when the petition was filed.1 1Unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Internal (continued...)- 2 - Pursuant to section 7463(b), the decision to be entered is not reviewable by any other court, and this opinion shall not be treated as precedent for any other case. Respondent determined deficiencies in income tax for 2014, 2015, and 2016 of $8,725, $7,085, and $5,890, respectively, and an accuracy-related penalty under section 6662(a) for each year. Respondent has conceded the accuracy-related penalties. He has also conceded that petitioner is entitled to claim two of her three children as qualifying child dependents for purposes of personal exemptions, the child tax credit, and the earned income credit for 2014, 2015, and 2016. The remaining issues are whether petitioner is entitled to head of household filing status for 2015 and 2016 and a $1,000 education credit for 2014. We find that she properly filed as head of household for 2015 and 2016. However, she has not established that she is entitled to the education credit for 2014.",

One of petitioner\u2019s children is disabled. The children\u2019s father did not claim the three children as his dependents for the years at issue, and he did not file as head of household for 2015 and 2016.

These conditions are, in relevant part: a. she was not married at the close of the taxable year; b. she was not a surviving spouse as defined in section 2(a); c. she maintained as her home a household whose membership included, for more than one-half of the taxable year, a",

See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); see also Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 165-67. An\u2019s testimony between the 2015 hearing and the 2017 hearing was inconsistent regarding the extent of his political activities in the United States. In 2015, he testified that he was an assistant editor of the magazine Beijing Spring. But in 2017, at the hearing specifically to address future persecution based on his activities in the United States, An did not mention his position as editor until asked about it on cross examination. The agency did not err in relying on this omission because it was a significant and specific fact that went to the heart of An\u2019s fear of future persecution. See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 78\u201379 (weight given to an omission depends, in part, on whether \u201cfacts are ones that a credible petitioner would reasonably have been expected to disclose under the relevant 4circumstances\u201d).

Nor did the agency err in relying on the discrepancy between An\u2019s testimony and his mother\u2019s letter regarding when the Chinese police approached and threatened his parents. An testified in March 2015 that Chinese authorities had learned of his activities in the United States and threatened his parents. But his mother\u2019s letter, submitted after the initial hearing, states that she and An\u2019s father learned of An\u2019s activities in the United States when the police questioned and threatened them in September 2015, i.e., after the hearing at which An testified to the threats. The agency 5did not err in relying on this discrepancy because it created an inconsistency in the timeline and the omission was central to An\u2019s fear of future persecution. See Hong Fei Gao, 891 F.3d at 79. Additionally, given the inconsistency with his parents\u2019 letters, An did not rehabilitate his questionable testimony with reliable corroborating evidence regarding his fear of future persecution upon return to China.

His convictions and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. United States v. Duhart, 379 F. App\u2019x 814, *1 (11th Cir. 2010) (per curiam) (unpublished).

In it, he argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 2551 (2015), rendered his \u00a7 924(c) conviction invalid.

Similar to the ACCA, \u00a7 924(c) also contains a residual clause, which defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that \u201cby its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7",

Separate from \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause is its elements clause, which defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as a felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d Id. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Mr. Duhart also argued that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery did not qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause because conspiracy does not require an overt act toward the commission of substantive Hobbs Act robbery. According to Mr. Duhart, because Johnson invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause, and because conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery was not otherwise a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause, Count 3 could not stand. The District Court agreed with Mr. Duhart and vacated his \u00a7 924(c) conviction. The government appealed, arguing (1) that the District Court was without jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) Johnson did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause. We held the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction over Mr. Duhart\u2019s second \u00a7 2255 motion, but reversed in light of our decision in In re Garrett, 908 F.3d 686 (11th Cir. 2018), which held that Johnson did not invalidate \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause.

Several months later the Supreme Court issued its decision in Davis, which struck down \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause as unconstitutionally vague. 139 S. Ct. at 2336. While our court has held that Davis announced a new rule of constitutional law retroactive to cases on collateral review, see In re Hammoud, 931 F.3d 1032, 1037\u201338 (11th Cir. 2019), we have also recognized two important limitations to Davis\u2019s scope. First, Davis addressed only the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on crimes of violence, while leaving undisturbed \u00a7 924(c) convictions predicated on drug trafficking crimes. See In re Navarro, 931 F.3d 1298, 1302 (11th Cir. 2019) (per curiam) (holding that \u00a7 924(c) convictions \u201cfully supported by [] drug-trafficking crimes\u201d are \u201coutside the scope of Davis\u201d). Second, Davis invalidated \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause but left its elements clause intact. See Brown, 942 F.3d at 1075. On October 7, 2019, the Supreme Court granted Mr. Duhart\u2019s petition for certiorari, vacated our decision denying his second \u00a7 2255 motion, and remanded for further consideration in light of Davis. Duhart v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 100 (2019). Though Davis now precludes liability under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s residual clause, our inquiry does not ordinarily end there.

See Navarro, 931 F.3d at 1302 (holding that defendant\u2019s factual proffer established that his \u00a7 924(c) charge was predicated on a drug trafficking crime, thus precluding relief under Davis). This court\u2019s decision in Brown squarely establishes that Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction was predicated not on a drug trafficking crime, but on a crime of violence. In Brown, the indictment charged the defendant with conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery, two drug trafficking crimes, and a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense. 942 F.3d at 1070\u201371. The indictment specified that the \u00a7 924(c) charge was predicated on both a crime of violence and drug trafficking crimes. Id. The defendant\u2019s plea agreement, however, identified only a crime of violence\u2014 conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery\u2014as the sole predicate for his \u00a7 924(c) charge. During the defendant\u2019s plea colloquy, the court explained that the \u00a7 924(c) charge to which he pled guilty was based only on a crime of violence. Id. at 1071. Because the defendant \u201cpled guilty to a \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) offense predicated only on conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery,\u201d we concluded that his \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction was not otherwise supported by a drug trafficking crime. Id. at 1074\u2013 75. Mr. Duhart\u2019s case is materially indistinguishable from Brown. His indictment lists both a crime of violence and a drug trafficking crime as predicates",

    "content": "for his \u00a7 924(c) count, but his plea agreement identifies only a predicate crime of violence. And during Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea colloquy, the court explained that his \u00a7 924(c) charge was based on a crime of violence, while making no mention of a predicate drug trafficking crime. On these facts, it is plain that Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) conviction was predicated only on a crime of violence. See Brown, 942 F.3d at 1074\u201375. IV. That brings us to whether the offense underlying Mr. Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction otherwise qualifies as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. As an initial matter, Mr. Duhart\u2019s plea agreement and colloquy make clear that the designated \u201ccrime of violence\u201d underlying his \u00a7 924(c) conviction was conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery rather than substantive Hobbs Act robbery. This distinction is important, because this court\u2019s precedent provides that substantive Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. In re Fleur, 824 F.3d 1337, 1340\u201341 (11th Cir. 2016) (per curiam). In contrast, this Court in Brown held that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s elements clause. 942 F.3d at 1075\u201376. Based on our precedent, then, the sole predicate offense for Duhart\u2019s \u00a7 924(c) conviction\u2014conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery\u2014cannot support his conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(3)\u2019s",

In her second complaint, Ms. Lynn sued Mr. Brown, the probate judge who presided in the guardianship proceedings, the court-appointed guardians and conservator, numerous attorneys, other named individuals and financial institutions, and 200 unknown individuals and entities. Her complaint references the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961-1968, and we refer to this complaint hereinafter as the \u201cRICO Complaint.\u201d Ms. Lynn asserted in this complaint that the court had both diversity and federal-question jurisdiction. Again acting sua sponte, the district court dismissed it without prejudice for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In so doing, the district court held diversity jurisdiction was lacking because there was not complete diversity among the parties, most of whom Ms. Lynn alleged were citizens of Oklahoma. It also found there was no basis on which to exercise federal-question jurisdiction because Ms. Lynn had fallen far short of stating a RICO claim. Ms. Lynn timely appealed the district court\u2019s order of dismissal, and that appeal is before us as No. 19-5063.

Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and Ms. Lynn, as the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction, had the burden of establishing the court\u2019s jurisdiction over each of her complaints. See Becker v. Ute 5Indian Tribe of Uintah & Ouray Reservation, 770 F.3d 944, 946-47 (10th Cir. 2014). As relevant here, this required her to establish either diversity jurisdiction as provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 or federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. See Home Depot U.S.A., Inc. v. Jackson, 139 S. Ct. 1743, 1746 (2019) (describing federal courts\u2019 limited jurisdiction).

THE STATE OF TEXAS, Appellee On Appeal from the 123rd District Court Panola County, Texas Trial Court No. 2017-C-0021 Before Morriss, C.J., Burgess and Stevens, JJ. Memorandum Opinion by Justice StevensMEMORANDUM OPINION Irish Shuntay Ware pled guilty to robbery and was placed on deferred adjudication community supervision for ten years under her plea bargain agreement with the State. The terms and conditions of Ware\u2019s community supervision required her to refrain from committing another criminal offense or consuming alcoholic beverages, among other things. The State moved to adjudicate Ware\u2019s guilt on several grounds, including that she committed the offense of driving while intoxicated (DWI) on June 1, 2019. After Ware pled true to this allegation and the trial court heard evidence on each ground in the State\u2019s motion, the trial court adjudicated Ware\u2019s guilt and sentenced her to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Ware claims she did not enter a plea of true to any allegation in the State\u2019s motion, but argues that her plea of true to one ground was involuntary because (1) she did not have fair notice of the basis of the revocation, (2) the motion to adjudicate lacked sufficient specificity, and (3) she was not made aware of the consequences of her plea. Ware also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that she",

Because Ware failed to file a motion to quash, her complaints about fair notice, specificity, and correctness of the State\u2019s motion to adjudicate guilt are unpreserved. Ware complains generally that she was unaware of the consequences of her plea. Article 26.13 requires a trial court to give certain admonishments to a defendant before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere. See TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 26.13 (Supp.). That said, as Ware notes, this Article does not apply to adjudication proceedings. See Gutierrez v. State, 108 S.W.3d 304, 309 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003). Even so, Ware argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding her plea of true voluntary because there was no discussion concerning the possible outcome of a plea. Before accepting Ware\u2019s plea of guilt on the underlying offense of robbery, the trial court entered the required Article 26.13 written admonishments, including the applicable range of punishment.

State, 665 S.W.2d 492, 493 (Tex. Crim. App. 1984)). With exception of failure-to-pay allegations made against indigent defendants who are unable to pay community supervision fines and fees, a plea of true standing alone is sufficient to support revocation of community supervision. See Cole v. State, 578 S.W.2d 127, 128 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1979). After hearing testimony on the State\u2019s motion, the trial court asked Ware, \u201cAll right, ma\u2019am. You have admitted on June 1st of 2019, you\u2019ve pled \u2018true\u2019 to intentionally operating a motor vehicle under the influence.

Ware\u2019s community supervision officer testified that Ware failed to report during the months of April and May, as alleged in the State\u2019s motion.

ORDER AND JUDGMENT* Before LUCERO, BALDOCK, and MORITZ, Circuit Judges. Justin Mohn, appearing pro se, appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to his former employer, Progressive Insurance, on his claims of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm. * After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.I. Background Progressive Insurance hired Mohn as a customer service representative in October 2016. New hires such as Mohn participate in Progressive\u2019s customer service academy program.

For example, \u00a7 6802(d)(1)(D) prohibits charging a fee to certain classes of visitors who pass through a statutory-fee area \u201cwithout using the facilities and services.\u201d This statutory exception applies to visitors who (1) drive through (without parking), (2) walk through, (3) boat through, (4) ride horses through, or (5) hike through. Id. Conspicuously unlisted are visitors who park at a fee area and claim not to use any amenities. See id. Enumerating the types of visitors who are exempt from fees when they do not use amenities demonstrates that Congress knows how to exempt visitors who do not use amenities. So by not exempting visitors who park in a (f)(4)-fee area without using amenities, Congress allows such visitors to be charged a fee despite not using all of the amenities. See Navajo Nation v.

Though the exception likely covers a visitor\u2019s pulling over to the roadside to hike or parking in an undeveloped lot to access hiking trails, it does not cover a visitor\u2019s parking in a developed lot with amenities. Most parking 5 Alpern\u2019s inability to do so for this location does not matter to our decision. The REA says nothing about providing free parking to visitors. And Alpern can always avoid the fee by taking a bus, hitching a ride, or biking into the valley. 10lots in public-land areas are located near trailheads. Often, that is why the lot is there\u2014to allow for easy public access to the trails. Adopting Alpern\u2019s proposed interpretation would render \u00a7 6802(f)(4)\u2019s allowance of fees for these areas illusory. We note as well that Alpern\u2019s argument that he parks in the developed lots without using any other amenity listed in \u00a7 6802(f)(4) is incomplete. The six listed amenities in \u00a7 6802(f)(4) are: (1) a \u201c[d]esignated developed parking\u201d lot; (2) a \u201cpermanent toilet facility[;]\u201d (3) a \u201cpermanent trash receptacle[;]\u201d (4) an \u201c[i]nterpretive sign, exhibit, or kiosk[;]\u201d (5) \u201c[p]icnic tables[;]\u201d and (6) \u201c[s]ecurity services.\u201d Though Alpern",

Now, let\u2019s assume Alpern would not want the officer to intervene, how would this be accomplished? Would he need to put a sticker on his car indicating to security officers that they should let would-be intruders go about their business uninterrupted? Wouldn\u2019t that just invite break-ins? 11Or perhaps officers could refuse to intervene when a car lacks proof of paying the fee\u2014an approach that would also invite thieves.6 This demonstrates the difficulty that would result from adopting Alpern\u2019s reading of the statute.
