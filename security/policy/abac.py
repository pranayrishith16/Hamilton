"""
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions.

Attributes:
  User: department, clearance level, tenure, location
  Resource: classification, client, sensitivity, document type
  Context: time of day, IP address, device type, MFA status

Example Policies:
  - User can access doc IF (user.clearance >= doc.classification)
  - Export allowed IF (time == business_hours AND user.mfa_verified)
  - Query allowed IF (user.department == "Litigation" AND doc.client IN user.assigned_clients)

Features:
  - Dynamic policy evaluation at runtime
  - Support complex boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Policy stored in YAML or database
  - No code changes needed for policy updates

Classes:
  - ABACEngine: Policy evaluation engine
  - PolicyEvaluator: Evaluate expressions
  - AttributeProvider: Fetch user/resource attributes

Standards: XACML-inspired
